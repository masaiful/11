This is what it takes to view a read a bloody article _with_ a [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/) to block ads. I don't even want to get started on the AMP nonsense. First, a focus-stealing popup asking if you'd like to subscribe to some bullshit.

Followed by another popup asking you'd subscribe to _more_ bullshit.

After which you can _finally_ see what you came for... which helpfully occupies the bottom 20% of the viewport ðŸ’¯
