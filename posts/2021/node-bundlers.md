[Nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe) and [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) are two compilers that create self-contained executables out of your Node scripts.

Deno [introduced this](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/986#issuecomment-740756795) in a recent release, which got me looking for Node-based alternatives.
