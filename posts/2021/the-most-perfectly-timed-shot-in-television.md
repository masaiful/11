Fat claim, but I cannot imagine anything more badass than this.

Here's [the full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WoDQBhJCVQ). The presenter's [James Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_(science_historian)). From the YouTube comments:

> I remember seeing an interview with him and the person asking him the question asked him "How was that shot perfectly timed?" He said "I just saw the count down clock and we waited until minus 10 seconds to start recording".

> And there was an assistant doing the count down with his fingers that Burke could se [sic] so Burke could time it perfectly.
