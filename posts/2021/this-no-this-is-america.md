> Lord of our lives and sovereign of our beloved nation, we deplore the desecration of the United States Capitol building, the shedding of innocent blood, the loss of life, and the quagmire of dysfunction that threaten our democracy.
> 
> These tragedies have reminded us that words matter and that the power of life and death is in the tongue. We have been warned that **eternal vigilance continues to be freedom's price**.
> 
> Lord, you have helped us remember that **we need to see in each other a common humanity that reflects your image**.
> 
> You have strengthened our resolve to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies domestic as well as foreign.
> 
> Use us to bring healing and unity to our hurting and divided nation and world. Thank you for what you have blessed our lawmakers to accomplish in spite of threats to liberty.
> 
> Bless and keep us. Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to do your will and guide our feet on the path of peace. And God bless America. We pray in your sovereign name, amen.
