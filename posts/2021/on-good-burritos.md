I remember the very first burrito I had in the Mission District in San Francisco. My friend warned me that it would be "around the size of your forearm" and that, if I tried to finish it in a single sitting, I would be an idiot. It was, I did, I am 🙏

> i do not fuck with any burrito without heft. if your shit is convenient and portable, take it elsewhere. i want a burrito that is burdensome. unwieldy. when i raise it to my mouth, i should feel the weight of the mistake i am about to make. no child should be able to eat this.

> if your burrito doesn’t make me hate myself both physically and spiritually, what’s the point? grow up. don’t waste my time.
