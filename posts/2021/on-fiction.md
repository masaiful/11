> It was the pivotal teaching of Pluthero Quexos, the most celebrated dramatist of the Second  Dominion, that in any fiction, no matter how ambitious its scope or  profound its theme, there was only ever room for three players. Between  warring kings, a peacemaker; between adoring spouses, a seducer or a  child. Between twins, the spirit of the womb. Between lovers, Death.  Greater numbers might drift through the drama, of course—thousands in  fact—but they could only ever be phantoms, agents, or, on rare  occasions, reflections of the three real and self-willed beings who  stood at the center. And even this essential trio would not remain  intact; or so he taught. It would steadily diminish as the story  unfolded, three becoming two, two becoming one, until the stage was left deserted.
