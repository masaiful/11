I made a bet at work that involved me eating my Crocs (if I lost, of course), prompting my co-worker to send me [this story](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/eric-taylor-eats-his-hat-2000-01-01) about Eric Taylor, a "former _Magic: The Gathering_ player and highly regarded Magic columnist, especially during the earlier days of the game" ([MTG Wiki](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Eric_Taylor)), who made a similarly hasty bet and honored its terms:

> He went so far as to guarantee Kai couldn't emerge victorious again, promising to eat his hat should he be proven wrong.
> 
> [...] By now a sizeable crowd had gathered to watch the spectacle. EDT began by biting into the rim, but couldn't tear the material with his teeth. In a quick burst of speed, he reached into his bag, and pulled out a full bottle of Heinz Ketchup and a pair of scissors. Deftly slicing a swatch of material from the top of the hat, he masticated on the felt but found the taste to be offensive.
> 
> "This is terrible!", he exclaimed, unleashing a destructive stream of ketchup all over the table and his headwear. He resumed devouring his hat, making chewing faces akin to Popeye the Sailor eating rotten spinach.
> 
> [...] Around the third mouthful, EDT began to wish he had a nacho hat. "This is terrible", he screamed, banging his jaw against the table to force the hat down. This attracted the attention of Rob Dougherty, from the Boston. "You're crazy!", he admonished in the typical Your Move Games tone. Eric just shook his head, gritted his teeth, and said, "**I have to do this.**"
