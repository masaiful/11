Was discussing water quality in Des Moines with DL. Told her that our city couldn't hold a candle to Ames, that their water was the "cleanest around." Wanted to prove this but couldn't find [the 2014 viral hit "_Hooray for Ames_" video](https://www.amestrib.com/article/20140530/News/305309925) anywhere on the internet. GN, blessed datahoarder that he is, luckily had a copy ❤️🚰
