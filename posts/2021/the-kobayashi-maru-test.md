> [...] the simulation takes place on a replica of a starship bridge, with the test-taker as captain and other Starfleet members, officers or other cadets, in other key positions. [...] the cadet receives a distress signal stating that the civilian freighter _Kobayashi Maru_ has struck a gravitic mine in the Klingon Neutral Zone and is rapidly losing power, hull integrity and life support. Sensor readings are indeterminate and there is no way to verify the distress signal. There are no other vessels nearby. The cadet must quickly make a decision:
> 
> * Attempt to rescue the Kobayashi Maru's crew and passengers, which involves violating the Neutral Zone and thereby provoking the Klingons into hostile action or possibly an all-out war; or
> * Abandon the Kobayashi Maru, preventing war with the Klingons but leaving the crew and passengers of the freighter to probable death.
> 
> [...] The objective of the test is not for the cadet to outfight or outplan the opponent but rather to force the cadet into a no-win situation and simply observe how they react.

I wondered how this related to [the Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) and came by [this great post by Tom Ingram](https://theyneverquite.wordpress.com/2014/01/01/kobayashi-maru-trolley-problem/).
