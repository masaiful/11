Here's to a Malarkey-Free America 🇺🇸🍦😎 Things won't magically start getting better. [He isn't perfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy). But he certainly is a decent human being, if _only_ because he isn't malevolent narcissism incarnate.

And unless your career depends on democratic dysfunction and systemic ineptitude, cruelty, and dishonesty that sow and sustain rancour[^metrics], you at _least_ ought to be relieved you won't have to say “God what the _fuck_ did he do _now_?” with the exhausting and dismaying frequency you did over the past four (THOUSAND) years. That's something.

🙏♥️🇺🇸
