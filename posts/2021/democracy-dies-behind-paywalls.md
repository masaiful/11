![Why can't Bezos fund WaPo in perpetuity?](/misc/d/democracy-paywalls.png)

"[World’s richest men added billions to their fortunes last year as others struggled: Billionaires have added about $1 trillion to their total net worth since the pandemic began](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/01/bezos-musk-wealth-pandemic/)" (WaPo, Paywall.)

> (Even though The Post is a complexifier for me, I do not at all regret my investment. The Post is a critical institution with a critical mission. My stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when I’m 90 and reviewing my life, if I’m lucky enough to live that long, regardless of any complexities it creates for me.)
