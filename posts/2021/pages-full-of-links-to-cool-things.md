[Terra](https://marijn.uk/linkroll/), [Gossip's Web](https://gossipsweb.net/), and [Marijn's Linkroll](https://marijn.uk/linkroll/) remind my (oldass) self of a more innocent time when one would 'surf the internet', come by a list of links another human being liked, and discover all sorts of strange and wacky handmade things. I think I'm saying I really miss how _fun_ [something like Geocities](https://neocities.org/) was.
