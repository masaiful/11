As of the 4^th^ of February 2021, and under its Governor's wise, prescient, expert and data-driven leadership, [Iowa ranks 47^th^ in the nation](https://www.kcci.com/article/iowas-covid-19-vaccination-rate-is-47th-in-the-us/35423114) for the number of vaccines administered 💯 

> Iowa has received 446,825 doses of vaccine and has administered 266,777 doses, or just under 60% of vaccines received, the CDC reported Thursday. The state has the sixth-lowest rate of administered vaccine per capita in the nation.

> “We’re averaging about 60% in getting the vaccines administered and that’s not where we need to be,” Reynolds said. “We want to do better. We know we can do better.”

We certainly can. The number of COVID-related deaths in Iowa stood at 5,033 as of this date. The very _next_ day, our fearless Governor signed [a Public Health Disaster proclamation](https://governor.iowa.gov/press-release/gov-reynolds-signs-new-public-health-disaster-proclamation) that, compared to its predecessor, ended mask mandates and removed all limits on public gatherings.

In time for the Super Bowl, of course.

> All of these relaxations at this stage of the pandemic make about as much sense as wearing underwear constructed out of nails and thumbtacks. If anything, Iowa should be enhancing precautions during the next several weeks, as long as the colder temperatures and drier air may be driving greater transmission of the virus. What is the scientific justification for what Reynolds has declared in the emergency declaration? It’s unclear. Seems like someone may owe Iowa an explanation.

Other the the usual bullshit conservative pabulum about freedom and small businesses and bootstraps and moochers and handouts, I don't expect any explanation that makes sense.
