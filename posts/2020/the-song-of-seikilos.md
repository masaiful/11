[This is the "the oldest surviving complete musical composition](/misc/s/song_of_seikilos.m4a), including musical notation, from anywhere in the world" and dates from "either from the 1st or the 2nd century AD." It was found engraved on a tombstone and was "dedicated by Seikilos to Euterpe, who was possibly his wife." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seikilos_epitaph))
