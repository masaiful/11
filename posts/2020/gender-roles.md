[Sofia Tolstoy](http://poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record82d6.html?id=25881), at 19, after the first of their thirteen children:

> I am left alone morning, afternoon and night. I am to gratify his pleasure and nurse his child, I am a piece of household furniture. I am a _woman_. I try to suppress all human feelings. When the machine is working properly it heats the milk, knits a blanket, makes little requests and bustles about trying not to think — and life is tolerable. But the moment I am alone and allow myself to think, everything seems insufferable.

[At 25](https://bookmunch.wordpress.com/2010/02/23/%E2%80%98a-midnight-plunge-into-a-freezing-pond%E2%80%99-the-diaries-of-sofia-tolstoy/):

> I am so often alone with my thoughts that the need to write in my diary comes quite naturally [...] Now I am well again and not pregnant — it terrifies me how often I have been in that condition. He said that for him being young meant "I can achieve anything." For me [...] reason tells me that there is nothing I either want or can do beyond nursing, eating, drinking, sleeping, and loving and caring for my husband and babies, all of which I know is happiness of a kind, but why do I feel so woeful all the time, and weep as I did yesterday? I am writing this now with the pleasantly exciting sense that nobody will ever read it, so I can be quite frank with myself [...].

And:

> I have served a genius for almost forty years. Hundreds of times I have felt my intellectual energy stir within me and all sorts of desires - a longing for education, a love of music and the art. And time and again I have crushed and smothered these longings. Everyone asks, "But why should a worthless woman like you need an intellectual or artistic life?" To this question I can only reply: "I don’t know, but eternally suppressing it to serve a genius is a great misfortune."
