To the surprise of no one (well, _normal_ people), "[The Kraken](/tags/shitkraken)", authored by an ex-member of the "Elite Strike-Force Team", turned out to be a "truly awful" and unmistakably QAnon-laced lawsuit full of basic formatting, spelling, and grammatical errors that would "drive a proofreader to drink."

From a must-read via PLG:

> **This is all batshit crazy. It is as stupid an elections lawsuit as I’ve ever seen. And there’s no guarantee that it’s the worst case we’re going to see**, because even though their legal arguments are being dismissed with extreme prejudice, when it comes to the political/propaganda aims of the litigants—this stuff works. Once the true believers are on board, it’s hard to get them off.

Amazing. It's almost as if The Best People don't really care about the substance of the lawsuits[^dragon] but want to _seen_ as filing them in the courts of "activist" judges who swat them away, quite unfairly of course, for the sophomoric and baseless crocks of shit they are. [Conservative, Republican, Trump-appointed](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/27/appeals-court-trump-campaign-pennsylvania-440813) activist judges, that is.

[^dragon]: And as if they 'wrote' it using a 1999 version of [Dragon NaturallySpeaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_NaturallySpeaking).
