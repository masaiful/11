> You could almost just narrate the body changes and narrate the dream. So here she's asleep. She sees a crab and her color starts to change a little bit then she turns all dark. Octopuses will do that when they leave the bottom. This is a camouflage like she's just subdued a crab and now she's going to sit there and eat it and she doesn't want anyone to notice her. It's a very unusual behavior to see the color come and go on her mantle like that. I mean, just to be able to see all the different color patterns just flashing one after another... you don't usually see that when an animal's sleeping which really is fascinating.

> But yeah if she's dreaming _that's_ the dream.
