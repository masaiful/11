by the incomparable [Herb Ritts](https://www.google.com/search?q=herb+ritts&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X). Not the same _Dracula_, but seeing these made me think of one of my favorite things: "[_Horrible Tragedy_](https://open.spotify.com/track/46EGPjNMDDVc6ofxVelN1B)" by Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet for [the 1931 movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_(album)).
