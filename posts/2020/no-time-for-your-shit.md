I wish they would blare portions of [Tom Cruise's COVID meltdown](https://twitter.com/rexchapman/status/1339020608294838273) at all grocery stores in [my lovely state](https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-covid-19-cases-deaths-december-17/35002185). Someone on /r/desmoines posted an [anti-masker patriot at our Costco](https://www.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/kf5v5g/anti_masker_at_des_moines_costco_on_121620/) who could use this message.

> I’m on the phone with every f–king studio at night, insurance companies, producers, and they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies. We are creating thousands of jobs you motherf–kers.
> 
> I don’t ever want to see it again, ever! And if you don’t do it you’re fired, if I see you do it again you’re f–king gone. And if anyone in this crew does it – that’s it, and you too and you too. And you, don’t you ever f–king do it again.
> 
> That’s it! No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their f-ing homes because our industry is shut down. It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education.
> 
> That’s what I sleep with every night. The future of this f–king industry! So I’m sorry I am beyond your apologies. I have told you and now I want it and if you don’t do it you’re out. We are not shutting this f–king movie down! Is it understood?
> 
> If I see it again you’re f–king gone — and you are — so you’re going to cost him his job, if I see it on the set you’re gone and you’re gone.
> 
> That’s it. Am I clear?
> 
> Do you understand what I want? Do you understand the responsibility that you have? Because I will deal with your reason. And if you can’t be reasonable and I can’t deal with your logic, you’re fired. That’s it. That is it.
> 
> I trust you guys to be here. That’s it. That’s it guys. Have a little think about it. . . [inaudible].
> 
> That’s what I think of Universal and Paramount. Warner Brothers. Movies are going because of us. If we shut down it’s going to cost people f–king jobs, their home, their family. That’s what’s happening.
> 
> All the way down the line. And I care about you guys, but if you’re not going to help me you’re gone. OK? Do you see that stick? How many meters is that?
> 
> When people are standing around a f–king computer and hanging out around here, what are you doing? And if they don’t comply then send their names to Matt Spooner. That’s it.
