[Rex Parker](https://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/):

> A long time ago, I was solving this puzzle and got stuck at an unguessable (to me) crossing: N. C. WYETH crossing `NATICK` at the "N" — I knew `WYETH` but forgot his initials, and `NATICK`... is a suburb of Boston that I had no hope of knowing. It was clued as someplace the Boston Marathon runs through (???). Anyway, `NATICK` — the more obscure name in that crossing — became shorthand for an unguessable cross, esp. where the cross involves two proper nouns, neither of which is exceedingly well known. `NATICK` took hold as crossword slang, and the term can now be both noun ("I had a `NATICK` in the SW corner...") or verb ("I got `NATICKED` by 50A / 34D!")

Here's [the Urban Dictionary entry](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Natick). Learned that that "[_crosswordese_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosswordese)" is a thing. Been doing the NYT Crosswords fairly regularly over the past few years and that page has a _lot_ of useful, vowel-y 'bridge' words and phrases (e.g. `AGRA`, `ESAU`, `ISAO`, `OMOO`, `DEUSIRAE`.)
