Some absolutely marvelous photos of a [Southen Blue-Ringed Octopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_blue-ringed_octopus) by [@SammyGlennDives](https://www.facebook.com/SammyGlennDives/)

Would love to find out what kind of protective gear the photographer had on. But it seems like the octopuses are very shy and will attack only when provoked, which is when their rings become more intense 🐙 The salivary venom[^venom_versus_poison], synthesized by bacteria and not the octopus itself, doesn't have an antidote and is only used to hunt and defend. It's either injected via the beak, or is [sprayed as a mist](/misc/i/its-a-trap.mp4), paralysing the prey in either case for the final kill (presumably involving more beak.)

Here's a little more. Love the intro. They truly are so _alien_ and so, _so_ beautiful 😍

[^venom_versus_poison]: Always have to look it up: **P**oison is **p**assive, venom is active.
