All emphases are mine.

> In a court filing signed by Rudy Giuliani and Marc Scaringi[^scaringi] â€” the two remaining attorneys on the case **after everyone else quit** â€” the campaign asked for the judge to hand over Pennsylvania's electors.

> "You're asking this court to invalidate more than 6.8 million votes, **thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the commonwealth**," Brann said at the hearing. "Can you tell me how this result can possibly be justified?"

> -- "[_Rudy Giuliani straight up asked a federal judge to ignore Pennsylvania voters and declare Trump won the state_](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/rudy-giuliani-straight-up-asked-a-federal-judge-to-ignore-pennsylvania-voters-and-declare-trump-won-the-state/articleshow/79312082.cms)."

And:

> Before Tuesday, Rudy Giuliani **last registered an appearance in the U.S. federal judiciary [in 1992](https://twitter.com/ZoeTillman/status/1328714995237056514/photo/1)**, and in the view of many legal observers, it showed. The former mayor of New York flubbed basic concepts of law and, in at least one instance, displayed a poor command of the English language.
>
> Giuliani confessed that he did not know the word "opacity," applying the Bizarro World definition that it "probably means you can see."
>
> "It means you canâ€™t," U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann corrected[^rudy_big_words].

> When pressed by the judge on what standard of scrutiny should be applied to Pennsylvania governmentâ€™s action, Giuliani replied: "**The normal one**."

> -- "[_When Applying â€˜Normalâ€™ Scrutiny, Rudy Giulianiâ€™s Court Appearance Was a Total Flop_](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/when-applying-normal-scrutiny-rudy-giulianis-court-appearance-was-a-total-flop/)"

And because IANAL, some helpful context:

> At one point, he even appeared ignorant of the concept of strict scrutiny, a basic and fundamental concept for a practicing lawyer to know when arguing a case on Fourteenth Amendment grounds. **Imagine if you were lying in an operating room, about to go under general anesthesia, and heard your surgeon ask, "Hey, what are all these knives for?"** Now you are in general orbit around whatever planet on which the former New York mayor happens to be residing.

> -- "[_The Unpardonable Sins of Lindsey Graham_](https://newrepublic.com/article/160254/lindsey-graham-trump-coup-georgia)"

Onward:

> At one point he referred to president-elect Joe Biden as a "crook" and **chastised the press for reporting that he has no evidence of fraud. Mr Giuliani has offered no evidence in court of fraud**.

> He compared election observers being corralled away from the votes counts to a moment in the movie in which the eponymous character asks a witness in court how many fingers he is holding up, claiming that they could not see a thing.

> As [what appeared to be hair dye](https://static-log.nikhil.io/h/hair-dye.jpeg) dripped down both sides of his face...

> Ms Ellis described the assembled lawyers as "**an elite strike-force team**" working on behalf of the president.

And finally:

> President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign says itâ€™s dropping its Michigan election lawsuit because it **succeeded in halting certification** of election results in Detroit and surrounding Wayne County, **despite the outcome already having been certified in favor of President-elect Joe Biden**.

> -- "[_Trump Campaign Drops Michigan Election Suit, Claims Victory_](https://static-log.nikhil.io/r/rudy-4.html)."

An "Absolutely Brilliant" Elite Mercurial Powerhouse Leader of the Most A+ Legal Team one could assemble given the seriousness of the [charges against our democratic systems](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/11/12/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election), folks ðŸŒª So _unbelievably_ competent, [Snopes had to publish an entry](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/giuliani-quotes-trump-case/) about his return to court ðŸ’¯

No, really:

**Update** 20 Nov 2020.

> But his attorneys have repeatedly made elementary errors in those high-profile cases: **misspelling "poll watcher" as "pole watcher," forgetting the name of the presiding judge during a hearing, inadvertently filing a Michigan lawsuit before an obscure court in Washington and having to refile complaints after erasing entire arguments theyâ€™re using to challenge results**.
> 
> "The sloppiness just serves to underscore the lack of seriousness with which these claims are being brought," said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.

> "**I know crimes. I can smell them**," Giuliani said as [streaks of sweat and what appeared to be hair dye ran down the sides of his face](https://static-log.nikhil.io/b/BORG.jpeg). "You donâ€™t have to smell this one. I can prove it to you 18 different ways."

> "Part of the reason he doesnâ€™t have good lawyers is he doesnâ€™t have good claims to bring."

[^rudy_big_words]: ["Big words, your honor," Giuliani said.](https://static-log.nikhil.io/r/rudy-5.html)

[^scaringi]: "The day before a major argument in Pennsylvania, three lawyers for Trump withdrew and were replaced in part by Marc Scaringi, an attorney and talk show host who wrote a blog post after the election referring to 'President-elect Joe Biden.' Scaringi himself had told listeners on his radio show days after the election that 'there are really no bombshells' about to drop 'that will derail a Biden presidency,' and noting that several of the lawsuits 'donâ€™t seem to have much evidence to substantiate their claims.' - [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-election-results-rudy-giuliani-lawyers-b1759104.html)
