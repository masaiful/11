All emphases are mine.

> In a court filing signed by Rudy Giuliani and Marc Scaringi — the two remaining attorneys on the case **after everyone else quit** — the campaign asked for the judge to hand over Pennsylvania's electors.

> "You're asking this court to invalidate more than 6.8 million votes, **thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the commonwealth**," Brann said at the hearing. "Can you tell me how this result can possibly be justified?"

-- "[_Rudy Giuliani straight up asked a federal judge to ignore Pennsylvania voters and declare Trump won the state_](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/rudy-giuliani-straight-up-asked-a-federal-judge-to-ignore-pennsylvania-voters-and-declare-trump-won-the-state/articleshow/79312082.cms)."

And:

> Before Tuesday, Rudy Giuliani **last registered an appearance in the U.S. federal judiciary [in 1992](https://twitter.com/ZoeTillman/status/1328714995237056514/photo/1)**, and in the view of many legal observers, it showed. The former mayor of New York flubbed basic concepts of law and, in at least one instance, displayed a poor command of the English language.
> 
> Giuliani confessed that he did not know the word "opacity," applying the Bizarro World definition that it "probably means you can see."
> 
> "It means you can’t," U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann corrected[^rudy_big_words].

> When pressed by the judge on what standard of scrutiny should be applied to Pennsylvania government’s action, Giuliani replied: "**The normal one**."

-- "[_When Applying ‘Normal’ Scrutiny, Rudy Giuliani’s Court Appearance Was a Total Flop_](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/when-applying-normal-scrutiny-rudy-giulianis-court-appearance-was-a-total-flop/)"

And because IANAL, some helpful context:

> At one point, he even appeared ignorant of the concept of strict scrutiny, a basic and fundamental concept for a practicing lawyer to know when arguing a case on Fourteenth Amendment grounds. **Imagine if you were lying in an operating room, about to go under general anesthesia, and heard your surgeon ask, "Hey, what are all these knives for?"** Now you are in general orbit around whatever planet on which the former New York mayor happens to be residing.

-- "[_The Unpardonable Sins of Lindsey Graham_](https://newrepublic.com/article/160254/lindsey-graham-trump-coup-georgia)"

> At one point he referred to president-elect Joe Biden as a “crook” and **chastised the press for reporting that he has no evidence of fraud. Mr Giuliani has offered no evidence in court of fraud**.

> He compared election observers being corralled away from the votes counts to a moment in the movie in which the eponymous character asks a witness in court how many fingers he is holding up, claiming that they could not see a thing.

> As [what appeared to be hair dye](https://static-log.nikhil.io/h/hair-dye.jpeg)[^rudy_borg] dripped down both sides of his face...

> Ms Ellis described the assembled lawyers as "**an elite strike-force team**" working on behalf of the president.

And finally: 

> President Donald Trump’s campaign says it’s dropping its Michigan election lawsuit because it **succeeded in halting certification** of election results in Detroit and surrounding Wayne County, **despite the outcome already having been certified in favor of President-elect Joe Biden**.
