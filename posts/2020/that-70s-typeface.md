Spent a few frustrated hours over the years trying to identify this typeface I'd see on restaurant menus, photocopied class handouts, movie titles (even [Indian ones from the early 80s](/misc/c/challenge_souvenir.png)), and a lot of books. I now know what it is and am quite happy the mystery's resolved.

It's [_Souvenir_](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/souvenir/)! Designed in 1914, super-popular/overused in the 70s, and much derided by designers in later decades ("_[A terrible typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souvenir_(typeface)). A sort of 'Saturday Night Fever' typeface wearing tight white flared pants._")
