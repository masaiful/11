I first saw this when I was about 10 and tried [my first jigsaw puzzle](/misc/n/nine_pints_puzzle.jpg) with my little sister. We were quite mesmerized by the painting. We found the puzzle too difficult and lost the pieces. 26 years later, I found a complete puzzle on eBay and can't wait to put it together with her ðŸ˜ƒ

Googling revealed that a certain David Lewis [recreated the painting with real officers](https://www.hertspastpolicing.org.uk/content/police-history/police/nine_pints_of_the_law) of the Royston Police Station in Hertfordshire in 1990.
