Well, shit. Emphasis mine:

> ...  a judge in Wisconsin dismissed the fourth and final lawsuit, noting that it is voters, not judges, who decide who goes to the White House.
>
> “**Federal judges do not appoint the president in this country**,” U.S. District Judge Pamela Pepper wrote in a 45-page ruling.
>
> “One wonders why the plaintiffs came to federal court and asked a federal judge to do so. After a week of sometimes odd and often harried litigation, the court is no closer to answering the ‘why.’ But this federal court has no authority or jurisdiction to grant the relief the remaining plaintiff seeks.”

The article notes that Judge Pepper also had to point out the [following errors](/posts/604b13ab79105c51b81dcfb285c356c7):

* "that Powell had sought 48 hours’ worth of surveillance footage from the TCF Center — which is in Michigan, not Wisconsin."
* "that Powell misspelled the name of her lead plaintiff, referring to  William Feehan, a would-be Trump elector, as 'Meehan.'"
* "that the plaintiff appeared to have made up a quote purporting to come from a decision made by Pepper’s own colleague Judge J. P. Stadtmueller. The quote simply doesn’t exist."
