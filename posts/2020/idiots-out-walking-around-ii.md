[Informed Choice Iowa](http://informedchoiceiowa.com/) is a group that "_unites Iowans seeking to preserve their medical freedoms._" They are "_pro-science_" folk that count '_"ex-vaxxers", "selective vaxxers", "non-vaxxers", and "vaxxers"_' among their members. I'm _guessing_ that this list doesn't include a single practicing physician.

And here's them celebrating their freedoms, by which they mean a blatant disregard for [the science](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/science/wear-mask-covid-particles-ul.html) they claim to love and [the Iowans](https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/iowa-coronavirus-cases-covid-19-hospitlizations-patient-numbers-increase-20201023) they claim to serve. Need some confirmation but I hear that eating at least two tubes of toothpaste is on the agenda for their next congregation.
