I couldn't finish this [gripping yet harrowing podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/root-evil-true-story-hodel-family-black-dahlia/id1450277129) about the [Black Dahlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dahlia) murder and, whether or not he was complicit, an absolute [monster of a human being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hodel).
