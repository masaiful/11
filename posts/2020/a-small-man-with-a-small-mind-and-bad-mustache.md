A member of The Elite Strike-Force Team bemoaned [being "canceled" and asked to resign from an elite club](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/528522-trump-campaign-lawyer-resigns-from-gridiron-club-after-saying-krebs-should-be) after calling for violence against the country's former CyberSecurity chief who said that the elections were "the most secure in American history" (which was the opinion that got him fired.) Mercifully, Operation [#shitkraken](/tags/shitkraken) continues to deliver despite this minor upset.

Here's some lovely, old-school, traditional, _conservative_ barbarism:

> “Anybody who thinks the election went well, like that idiot Krebs … he should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot,” diGenova said on [the radio show](https://howiecarrshow.com/).

Which drew this impassioned response from a Georgia election official:

It was all "hyperbole" and "in jest", of course! They tend to pick [the best subjects for humor](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/06/white-house-trump-was-just-joking-about-a-deadly-pandemic). And only the most Elite can handle the spotlight:

> “It’s egregious, I’m at a loss for words at how absurd those and offensive those comments were, I think that’s got to violate some type of code of professional conduct for the DC Bar, and I hope they look into it,” Travis, the former deputy director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said at the Aspen Institute’s virtual Cyber Summit on Tuesday.

> “He’s a small man with a small mind and bad mustache,” Travis said of diGenova, adding that he hoped diGenova would “take back those words, apologize and recognize that maybe the hot lights of the studio got to him.”
