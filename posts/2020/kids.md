CK and I loved this [short and strange and beautiful 'game'](https://playkids.ch/) by artist [Michael Frei](https://www.michaelfrei.io/) and developer [Mario van Rickenbach](https://www.michaelfrei.io/).

There's even [an art exhibition](https://playkids.ch/presskit/). I don't know. Take it for what it is.
