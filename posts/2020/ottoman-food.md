I found out I am to thank the Ottomans for a lot of my favorite things to eat and drink:

* Baklava (which dates back two thousand years, to the Assyrian Empire)
* Coffee made the Right Wayâ„¢
* The modern kebab
* Shawarma
* Sherbet
* Dolma (stuffed food) and Sarma (wrapped food)
* An ancestor of the hummus: a chickpea spread flavored with cinnamon, pine nuts, and currants. Consumed with bread and popular in the 15th century
* Ayran: My absolute favorite thing to drink on a hot day. Couldn't find many differences between ayran and the laban I grew up drinking.
