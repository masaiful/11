Was looking for a portable iPhone microscope and came by [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Microscope-Magnification-Inspection-Compatible-Smartphone/dp/B07PVMRZQH/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Iphone+Microscope&qid=1604339213&sr=8-3) on Amazon. Doubted the "50x-1000x magnification" claim and landed on this video by [Oliver Kim](http://www.microbehunter.com/about/) (here's [his channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Microbehunter/videos)) on how to make sense of that feature.

The key idea here is to think of a microscope as a device that _**resolves** hitherto unseen things_. It's simply not _just_ a _magnifier_ of small things our eyes cannot resolve. This is the difference between the 2x optical zoom on your iPhone versus the 10x you can slide it up to.

So I don't doubt that the product on Amazon can do 50x, which is fine for my needs. I just don't believe that the upper bound (1000x) can provide anything useful.
