On tech culture's obsession with quantifying and optimizing every single moment of one's existence[^leverage_value]:

> I hate this framing. It is pressuring, dehumanizing as it contextualizes human endeavor in transactional terms, usually in a market.
>
> I know this goes against the ethos of high-tech, but humans don't have an imperative to be as _productive_ as possible. They don't have to make the _most_ use of their time. They don't have to get as _efficient_ as they could. These are metrics that work fine for our machines, our code. But humans are not machines. Sure, we shepherd the machines, and sure sometimes we are in rivalrous dynamics that increasing efficiency has a payoff, but it is never the goal in itself.
>
> The real "currency" we have, if we are using the term in the sense of denoting essentialness, is our humanness, our mortality, our psyches, our connection with other people and seemingly mundane but meaningful parts of our lives. I mean, look how many of us started baking their breads and _enjoying_ it. It is not a wise use of the "currency of time", but it is part of life very well spent, as our internal reward mechanisms have been telling us.

[^leverage_value]: With corroboration via sophomoric interpretations of stoicism and objectivism, all aimed at summoning this latent, dispassionate Ã¼bermensch whose sole purpose is to "leverage" and deliver _value_.
