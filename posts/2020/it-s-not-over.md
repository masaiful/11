Until _all_ votes are counted.
Until all votes are _recounted_.
Until all votes are recounted _by hand_.
Until [the lawsuits](/posts/ac575166772052fc918f0fd134993bbb) are filed.
[Until the lawsuits are appealed at the _State_ Supreme Courts](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/wisconsin-supreme-court-tosses-trump-election-lawsuit-74717684).
[Until the lawsuits are appealed at _the_ Supreme Court](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/us/politics/supreme-court-election-texas.html).
[Until the states certify the results](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/09/politics/2020-election-results-certified/index.html).
[Until the electors vote](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-social-affairs-elections-ap-news-alert-electoral-college-9f7c5bbc89077e7cf52ae572de9bd18d).
Until the electors _maybe_ vote faithlessly.
Until Joe is sworn in on the 20^th^.

And it won't matter after that because, proof be damned, it was a _massive_ fraud perpetrated upon us.
