![People moving a goalpost](/misc/g/goalpost-moving.jpg)

Until _all_ votes are counted.
Until all votes are _recounted_.
Until all votes are recounted _by hand_.
Until [the lawsuits](/posts/ac575166772052fc918f0fd134993bbb) are filed.
Until the lawsuits are appealed at the _State_ Supreme Courts.
Until the lawsuits are appealed at _the_ Supreme Court.
Until the states certify the results.
Until the electors vote.
Until the electors vote faithlessly.
Until Joe is sworn in on the 20th.

And it won't matter after that because, proof be damned, it was a _massive_ fraud perpetrated upon us.
