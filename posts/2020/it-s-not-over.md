![People moving a goalpost](/misc/g/goalpost-moving.jpg)

Until _all_ votes are counted.
Until all votes are _recounted_.
Until all votes are recounted _by hand_.
Until [the lawsuits](/posts/ac575166772052fc918f0fd134993bbb) are filed.
Until the lawsuits are appealed at the _State_ Supreme Courts.
Until the lawsuits are appealed at _the_ Supreme Court.
Until the states certify the results.
Until the electors vote.
Until the electors _maybe_ vote faithlessly.
Until Joe is sworn in on the 20^th^.

And it won't matter after that because, proof be damned, it was a _massive_ fraud perpetrated upon us.
