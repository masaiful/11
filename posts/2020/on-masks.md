[Bill Burr on _The Joe Rogan Experience_](https://youtu.be/GO_rW0Bvy1I?t=2119):

> **BURR:** I don’t want to start this bullshit. I’m not gonna sit here with no medical degree, listening to you with no medical degree, with an American flag behind you smoking a cigar, acting like we know what’s up, better than the CDC. All I do, is I watch the news once every two weeks - I'm like, "Mask or no mask? Still mask? Alright, mask!" That's all I give a fuck about. I don't care. I just love how wearing a mask became like this fucking like soft thing that you were doing... like being courteous...”

> **BURR:** Why is it for bitches? That's just so stupid.

> **BURR:** Oh God you’re so tough with your fucking open nose and throat and your five o'clock shadow. This is a _man_ right here! A _man_ doesn't wear a mask.

Rogan's immediate response somehow reminded me of the "infantile phallocentric Nietzscheanism that is destroying modern human culture" from [one of my favorite articles](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/19/if-you-were-an-elephant-).

[^rogan_podcasts]: Here's [something of a guide to his podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKOI2QkrmSA&feature=emb_logo).
