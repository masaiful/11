> A mondegreen /ˈmɒndɪɡriːn/ is a mishearing or misinterpretation of a phrase as a result of near-homophony, in a way that gives it a new meaning. Mondegreens are most often created by a person listening to a poem or a song; the listener, being unable to clearly hear a lyric, substitutes words that sound similar and make some kind of sense.

Never been able to follow the lyrics to most songs and have done this for as long as I can remember. Things [can be misheard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZhxLjDLu6Y) but there are intentional mondegreens as well:

> A similar effect was created in Hindi in the 2011 Bollywood movie Delhi Belly in the song "[Bhaag D.K. Bose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xZyo6weod4)". While "D.K. Bose" appears to be a person's name, it is sung repeatedly in the chorus to form the deliberate mondegreen "_bhosadi ke_" (Hindi: भोसडी के), a Hindi expletive.
