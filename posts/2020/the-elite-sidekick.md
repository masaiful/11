'Reporters' at the Failing NYTimes explore: "[How Is Trump’s Lawyer Jenna Ellis ‘Elite Strike Force’ Material?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/us/politics/jenna-ellis-trump.html)" ([cached](/misc/j/jenna-ellis-trump.html)) I should just copypasta the whole thing but here we go:

> Since she graduated law school in 2011, **nothing in her record in the courtroom** [...] **shows any time spent litigating election law cases**.
>
> She holds herself out as an expert on the Constitution based on her self-published book and her teaching of pre-law classes to undergraduates. **She has never appeared in federal district or circuit court**, where most constitutional matters are considered, according to national databases of federal cases, and **does not appear to have played a major role in any cases beyond her criminal and civil work in Colorado**.

> The Trump campaign and its supporters have so far filed about 50 election-related lawsuits. **She has not signed her name or appeared in court to argue a single one**.

> “I find it astonishing that she’s gotten to this point,” said Stephanie Stout, a lawyer in private practice in Greeley, Colo., who worked with Ms. Ellis a few years ago defending a man who was accused of attempted murder. The partnership was short-lived, Ms. Stout said, because their client fired Ms. Ellis, deeming her not up to the job.
>
> “**She just didn’t have the legal chops**,” added Ms. Stout, who ultimately won the case on her own. “After that, Jenna decided that I had stolen the case from her.”

> Craig Silverman, a lawyer in Denver who used to host a radio show on legal matters and current events that Ms. Ellis occasionally appeared on, described her as “**an attorney of scant accomplishment**.” The cases she discussed with him, he recalled, were bread-and-butter criminal defense work. And he said he had **always expected her to pursue a career in teaching and media — not the law**.
>
> [...] Though Mr. Silverman once considered himself friendly with Ms. Ellis, he said her insistence of widespread voter fraud had so unnerved him that he believed **she might have violated Colorado’s rules of professional conduct for lawyers, which prohibit making false statements**.

> In 2015 she joined Colorado Christian University [...] [which] **does not have a law school or a program in constitutional law**. Ms. Ellis taught pre-law and political science to undergraduates and was part of the team that developed and advised a moot court program, according to a university spokesman. Eventually **she was made an assistant professor of legal studies — but never a “professor of constitutional law,” which is how she identified herself** in pieces for The Washington Examiner that she started writing in 2017.

Here's how you get noticed and get a spot on the ultra-selective Elite Strike-Force team: become "star player in the president’s theater of grievance and denial":

> But she did have an attribute that can carry just as much weight in his eyes: the ability to go on television and deliver scathing attacks on his critics.

> Ms. Ellis beat the drum for the president on cable and wherever else she had a platform.

> But those who know Ms. Ellis said they imagined that her willingness to say almost anything in the president’s defense was what he found appealing about her.

Her response is to simply call the entire thing a "false 'report'" and dream publicly about becoming the next Amy Coney Barrett.

> The failing NY Times plans to run a hit piece today. They’re trying to undermine the public’s confidence in the President’s election integrity battle by pushing a false “report” on my credentials & experience.
>
> Well... Libs said ACB wasn’t qualified. And she’s Justice ACB now. 😉
