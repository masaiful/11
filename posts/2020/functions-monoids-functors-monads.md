Started with this [blog post](http://codeninja.blog/2018/monads/) about why one would need a monad (from a typing standpoint.) Then watched "[What the ùíá is a Monad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSuu8zBBNAA)" which made a lot of things clear. Then watched this [excellent, _excellent_ talk on Lambda Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VQ382QG-y4) (with [JS](https://github.com/glebec/lambda-talk/blob/master/src/index.js) _and_ Haskell code!) by Gabriel Lebec.

Finished with a quick [practical, toy example by @mpjme](https://github.com/glebec/lambda-talk/blob/master/src/index.js) and this [Scala horror-show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw_Jnn_Y5iA) (to me.)
