Bilal GÃ¶regen ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJKTabEKg3qzzDhddAzJPGA), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bilalgoregen.official/)) is the Turkish street musician in my favorite video of 2020.

He sounds like a very positive, gracious, and sweet human being on [this KnowYourMeme interview](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/interviews/bilal-goregen-from-the-cat-vibing-to-street-musicians-ievan-polkka-meme-fills-us-in-on-what-its-like-to-become-an-internet-celebrity-overnight)[^editorials] which features this delightful nugget (emphasis mine):

> **Q:** How has the response been from your previous fans and followers that were around before the meme? Also, have you received any interesting or wholesome messages from fans since your meme went viral that you can share with us?
>

And here's him [making a lot of Indian people very happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEolsIlVnto). And lest I forget, this is the original Finnish folk song he's covering:
