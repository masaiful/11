Bilal Göregen ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJKTabEKg3qzzDhddAzJPGA), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bilalgoregen.official/)) is the Turkish street musician in my favorite video of 2020.

He sounds like a very positive, gracious, and sweet human being on [this KnowYourMeme interview](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/interviews/bilal-goregen-from-the-cat-vibing-to-street-musicians-ievan-polkka-meme-fills-us-in-on-what-its-like-to-become-an-internet-celebrity-overnight)[^editorials] interview which features this delightful nugget:

> **Q:** How has the response been from your previous fans and followers that were around before the meme? Also, have you received any interesting or wholesome messages from fans since your meme went viral that you can share with us?
>
> **A:** When I read the comments section after my video went viral, I see that my Turkish followers still do not understand the meme, and they ask questions like, "Is the channel stolen? Why are there so many foreigners here? Where are the Turks?"

Assorted Bilal things: Here's a [_ten-hour_ version of his viral hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nQU_8Nm0Yk&feature=emb_title). And here's him [making a lot of Indian people very happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEolsIlVnto).

And lest I forget, this is the original Finnish folk song he's covering:
