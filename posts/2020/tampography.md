Wondered how [Audemars Piguet printed the logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0uW37FnCLM) onto their tapisserie dial (at 1:45.) Using a Bloopy Thing to print on all sorts of materials is called ["Pad Printing" or tampography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pad_printing). Here's a _Big_ Bloopy Thing printing a very beautiful pattern onto a bowl (and here's [two of them going](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2OuxFHnEj0) at the same time.)
