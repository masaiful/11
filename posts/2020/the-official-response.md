> **WOOLEY.** What if the Prime Minister insists we help them?
> **SIR APPLEBY.** Then we follow the four-stage strategy.
> **WOOLEY.** What's that?
> **SIR WHARTON.** Standard Foreign Office response in a time of crisis.
> **SIR WHARTON.** In stage one we say nothing is going to happen.
> **SIR APPLEBY.** Stage two, we say something may be about to happen, but we should do nothing about it.
> **SIR WHARTON.** In stage three, we say that maybe we should do something about it, but there's nothing we *can* do.
> **SIR APPLEBY.** Stage four, we say maybe there was something we could have done, but it's too late now.
