I don't watch the show and tapped this YouTube suggestion on a lazy Sunday. This man pushed my capacities for sympathy and empathy to their breaking points in 20 minutes. I don't know what to type here other than quote the very first sentence of [his Fandom wiki page](https://hellskitchen.fandom.com/wiki/Raj_Brandston):

> Raj is widely regarded as one of the worst and most useless chefs in _Hell's Kitchen_ history.

Since I don't watch the show, the most charitable assessment I can offer after sitting through the highlight reel below is this: The man is wired very, _very_ differently (which I suppose makes for engaging (cruel?) television.)
