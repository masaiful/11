Saith The Lord to Socialist Democrats:

> [ha, nice try](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209&version=NIV). healthcare is about consumer choice. get a job and enroll in a market-based plan.
> 
> [no peter](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014%3A22-33&version=NIV) i won't help you that will only create dependency pick yourself up by your own sandal straps it's called personal responsibility.
> 
> [i would love to give you this](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+6&version=NIV), really i would but the richest israelites actually need this more so they can stimulate economic growth!
> 
> [sorry](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A35&version=NIV), feeding you would be a waste of resources. i'm just not seeing results.
