I _love_ [the movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountain) and was surprised to find out that there was a graphic novel that preceded it. A work of original and breathtaking beauty like the movie and [its soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountain_(soundtrack)). [Kent Williams'](https://www.artsy.net/artist/kent-williams) style and vision took a bit to get used to. Wonderful stuff.

Aronofsky notes in the book that the movie almost didn't happen due to budgetary concerns, and that he reworked it to make it a "lean, mean indie film." I wonder if that explains the [beautiful macrophotography they used for SFX](https://nofilmschool.com/2013/05/microscopic-cosmic-organic-vfx-fountain-tree-life).

Here it is [on ThriftBooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/the-fountain_darren-aronofsky/535074/#isbn=1401200583).
