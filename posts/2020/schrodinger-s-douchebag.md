Every Trump supporter you know:

> One who makes douchebag statements, particularly sexist, racist or otherwise bigoted ones, then decides whether they were “just joking” or dead serious based on whether other people in the group approve or not.

They're always "just joking." About [pandemic response](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/06/white-house-trump-was-just-joking-about-a-deadly-pandemic), about [requesting foreign interference](https://time.com/5573539/trump-clinton-russia-hack-joke/) in their country's elections, [injecting disinfectants](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-says-he-was-joking-when-he-asked-about-injecting-disinfectants-and-uv-light-to-treat-virus) to treat disease, asking for more [police brutality](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/31/why-police-departments-lashed-out-at-trump-for-his-comments-on-how-they-treat-suspects/), [mocking the disabled](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-worst-offense-mocking-disabled-reporter-poll-finds-n627736), [treason](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/sanders-trump-was-clearly-joking-with-treasonous-comments/2018/02/06/53f40d20-0b81-11e8-998c-96deb18cca19_video.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_14), [dangling pardons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/29/trump-is-joking-about-pardons-how-is-this-defense/) like a mob boss, [asking foreign governments to investigate political opponents](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article235800637.html), calling onself "[The Chosen One](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-says-he-was-joking-when-he-called-himself-the-chosen-one_n_5d6151f3e4b02cc97c8e6d26)", calling a former president [the founder of a terrorist organization](https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/12/politics/donald-trump-obama-clinton-isis-founder-sarcasm/index.html), or [condoning violence against journalists](https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/1053343508747165696). Just _look_ at your _face_, bro 😆

And then there's [Schrodinger's Asshole](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Schrodingers%20asshole):

> A person who decides whether or not they're full of shit by the reactions of those around them.
