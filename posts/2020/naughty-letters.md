Here's [a community-maintained "List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words)" across various languages on Github. I was curious about a naÃ¯ve frequency distribution of consonants across the [English-language corpus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words/master/en) (NSFW, obviously) and wrote [a small script](/misc/n/naughty-letters.py). Here are the results:

| Letter | Count |
|--------|-------|
|   t    |  211  |
|   s    |  208  |
|   n    |  193  |
|   r    |  186  |
|   l    |  167  |
|   g    |  147  |
|   c    |  124  |
|   b    |  121  |
|   p    |  116  |
|   h    |  97   |
|   d    |  91   |
|   m    |  91   |
|   k    |  72   |
|   y    |  70   |
|   f    |  48   |
|   w    |  41   |
|   v    |  29   |
|   j    |  21   |
|   x    |  19   |
|   z    |   7   |
|   q    |   5   |

Not sure what I'm going to do with this information but here it is. ðŸ¤¬
