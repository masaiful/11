> Trump has been saying the pandemic has been totally under control since [**January**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/trump-on-coronavirus-from-china-we-have-it-totally-under-control.html), and [said it would just "go away" in **February**](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-coronavirus-control-us-problem/story?id=69198905).
> 
> He [reiterated this in **March** as the virus surged](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/coronavirus-us-president-donald-trump-fauci-politics/index.html), and [insisted we had "perfect" tests that anyone could get](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-tour-centers-disease-control-prevention-atlanta-ga/) after [reports of faulty tests](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-test-kits/u-s-agency-investigating-production-of-faulty-coronavirus-test-kits-idUSKBN20P09Y). He said [he wanted pandemic-related shutdowns to end by Easter so churches could be "packed"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/24/coronavirus-trump-sets-easter-deadline-reopen-country/2912854001/) while [claiming Hydroxychloroquine would be a miracle cure for COVID-19](https://www.rollcall.com/2020/03/19/fda-walks-back-trump-claims-on-covid-19-drugs/).
> 
> In **April** he [continued to promote Hydroxychloroquine without evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump) and [suggested we could inject disinfectants or use UVC light inside the body to kill the virus](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-suggests-injection-disinfectant-beat-coronavirus-clean-lungs-n1191216), and right up through **May** [Trump was discouraging the use of masks and refused to require them anywhere](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/politics/donald-trump-mask-joe-biden/index.html), with him and Pence famously flouting requirements at [hospitals](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/28/mike-pence-visits-mayo-clinic-without-mask-215841) and [factories](https://time.com/5840833/trump-michigan-ford-plant-tour-mask/). Trump also claimed he was [taking Hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic against the disease](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-he-s-taking-hydroxychloroquine-prevent-covid-19-despite-n1209706). At this point they [were even planning to dismantle their own COVID-19 task force](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52553829).
> 
> In **June** [they were still insisting it was under control](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-says-the-epidemic-is-under-control-despite-surges-in-the-south-and-west/2020/06/29/bf6076be-b9ff-11ea-8cf5-9c1b8d7f84c6_story.html) while [fighting the FDA's revocation of authorizations for Hydroxychloroquine](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine/trump-critical-of-fda-decision-to-revoke-emergency-use-of-drug-he-has-promoted-for-covid-19-idUSKBN23M283), and [denying that there was a second surge happening](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/vice-president-mike-pence-op-ed-isnt-coronavirus-second-wave/). They instead blamed the high infection statistics on there being more testing, and [Trump suggested slowing down testing to improve the stats](https://apnews.com/article/476068bd60e9048303b736e9d7fc6572), noting [he does not joke](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-slow-down-testing-coronavirus-i-dont-kid/).

> Rolling into **July** [he still insisted he had things under control](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-07-04/ap-fact-check-trumps-empty-assurance-on-controlling-virus), claiming they had [done an incredible job](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/02/coronavirus-trump-touts-response-covid-19-daily-cases-surge/5359135002/), as the [White House nuked a trove of data previously available through the CDC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/16/us-coronavirus-data-has-already-disappeared-after-trump-administration-shifted-control-from-cdc-to-hhs.html) while Trump was still [hyping Hydroxychloroquine](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-doubles-defense-hydroxychloroquine-treat-covid-19-efficacy/story?id=72039824) and his son [was temporarily suspended from Twitter for continuing to spread disinformation about it](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/28/donald-trump-jr-twitter-restricted-hydroxychloroquine).

> Even in **August**, [Trump claimed COVID-19 was totally under control, and the ~150k dead with a simple "it is what it is,"](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/coronavirus-trump-insists-pandemic-is-under-control-in-us.html), and reiterated that [the virus would go away all on its own](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/business/china-economy-covid.html). He [finally encouraged the wearing of masks](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/03/politics/trump-masks-campaign-email/index.html), but [ignored all guidelines during his nomination acceptance speech at the Republican Convention](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/28/rnc-donald-trumps-speech-lacked-some-coronavirus-safeguards/5659672002/).

> In **September** [Trump was saying that COVID-19 hurt "virtually nobody"](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/09/22/donald-trump-coronavirus-covid-19-swanton-ohio-rally-newday-ldn-vpx.cnn), and [openly disputed the CDC's own claims about the effectiveness of masks](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-masks-health-experts/index.html).

> In **October** [Trump got COVID-19](https://www.npr.org/sections/latest-updates-trump-covid-19-results/2020/10/02/919385151/president-trump-and-first-lady-test-positive-for-covid-19), and while still undergoing treatment, [went on a quick spin around the hospital to wave to his supporters outside](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2020/10/05/a-look-at-trumps-armored-suv-and-why-that-photo-op-was-a-bad-idea/). He was [discharged to the White House after only three days](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-says-he-expects-to-be-discharged-from-the-hospital-monday-night-how-long-his-stay-compares-to-other-hospitalized-coronavirus-patients-2020-10-05), posing for [photo-ops without a mask](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-archive-d39bd670e8a280b6283abcdfc91d4794). At this point [White House officials finally concede that "we're not going to control the pandemic."](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-aide-says-were-not-going-to-control-the-pandemic). [This would be the last time the COVID-19 task force would formally meet](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1246838).

> Since then Trump has pretty much avoided any and all public appearances except to complain about the election. [**November** marked the point where a quarter of a million Americans had died of COVID-19](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/a-quarter-of-a-million-americans-are-now-dead-from-covid/). There are now [more people dying each day of COVID-19 than died in the terrorist attacks on 9/11/2001 or in the Invasion of Normandy](https://apnews.com/article/public-health-new-york-new-york-city-coronavirus-pandemic-a203294d021661100b57ddaeaa08bda9).
