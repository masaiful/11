> The list of 150 or so names was part of a larger file of more than 2,000 people who “voted in Wayne County by absentee ballot that are CONFIRMED deceased,” claimed Maddock, a prominent Republican **who is seeking to become the party’s state vice chair**.

It would appear that the only way to make it in the party is by embracing batshit crazy. But there _are_ pesky little 'facts' to contend with:

> “I am certainly not dead!” wrote one woman [...], including holiday photos of her family she had recently posted.
>
> “Two people in my neighborhood are on this list,” wrote another man. “They’re very much alive. Hell, their boys play baseball with my sons.”

Mr. Babcock speaks for Sane America that's bewildered by the post-election tantrums like these. Emphases mine:

> Among the alleged dead was Bill Babcock, a Grosse Pointe Woods voter who said Tuesday he is “doing fine,” aside from the grueling year-end inventory he was performing in his job as a swimming pool salesman.
>
> “**I think it sucks**,” he told Bridge Michigan on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after Maddock posted his name and home address in an attempt to prove voter fraud that state officials have not found.
>
> “**Can’t we just move on? There are bigger problems out there, like getting this vaccine thing situated**,” Babcock said.
