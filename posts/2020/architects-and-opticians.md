[Optician Sans](https://optician-sans.com/) is a free [optotype](https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/optotype) [^optotype] based on the [Sloan letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_letters)[^sloan_download].

[^optotype]: I had no idea this was a thing. There's a lot to learn here about the eye charts I see once a year. The earliest chart appears to go [all the way back to 1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart) (!) Those little "C"s are called [Landolt C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landolt_C). The one most optometrists use these days is called a [LogMAR Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogMAR_chart) which measures visual acuity as a log function of the smallest visual angle your eyes can resolve.

[^sloan_download]: Which you can [download here](https://github.com/denispelli/Eye-Chart-Fonts/) with "noncommercial research" in mind.
