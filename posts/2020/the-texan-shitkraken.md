The SC [swatted it away like the "Garbage, but dangerous garbage"](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/11/texas-lawsuit-supreme-court-election-results/) it was, but even this "[conservative evangelical American blogger and radio host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Erickson)" just _had_ it with the sycophantic tantrum:

> I personally think my company should pay me workers compensation for brain damage for having to read that lawsuit and related filings. It really is one of the stupidest bits of performative leg humping we have seen in the last five years. These attorneys general are willing to beclown themselves and their states all to get in good with the losing presidential candidate.
>
> The suit is absurd on its face. These states seek to interfere in the internal affairs of other states when those states are not actually electing the President, but allowing their voters to chose members of the Electoral College.

The lawsuit appears to be a pile of shit (one wouldn't expect any less from the Elite Strike Forces that surround the God Emperor) but:

> If Texas were to win this, it would dissolve the horizontal federalism of our union and only expand the powers of the federal government. It would also lead to a Civil War as a handful of states overturn the rules and laws of other states and dictate those states’ internal affairs. Wait for Gavin Newsom and Andrew Cuomo to give this precedent a whirl. Wait for progressive states to start suing conservative states over religious liberty, transgender rights, police brutality, tax policies that “steal” residents of progressive states, etc.

One can dream! He ends with a plea (emphasis mine):

> I’m really tired of the **Republican Party beclowning itself for a losing candidate out of fear for that candidate’s voters**. That is all this is and delusions of fools notwithstanding, despite all sorts of stupid arguments being wrapped in pomp and “equal protection” phraseology, the election is over and Joe Biden will be President-Elect officially next week.

> Guys, come on — you’re just going [to spark crazy to violence](/links/22544f50b3b05520921768d56ad5036b) [sic] at this point. **The election wasn’t stolen and most of you know it and those of you who don’t know it need to, at some point, realize you’ve been lied to**. And frankly, Ken Paxton needs to work on repentance for a whole lot of stuff.

Things are so crazy, that's reasonable stuff from _this_ guy:
