> Despite being cut loose from President Donald Trump’s legal team, Powell is forging ahead with her election-conspiracy crusade to overturn Joe Biden’s presidential win.

> But the conservative attorney’s self-described Kraken keeps getting its tentacles tied in a knot of [typos and errors](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/03/sidney-powell-trump-election-lawsuit-442472) — including the recent backward claim, later amended, that a pernicious voting algorithm took votes from Biden and flipped them to Trump.

So when she tried to argue that "pernicious" algorithms in Dominion's voting machines[^algorithms] flipped the election in Georgia _for_ her guy? Well it was really late at night and she had other shit to do and she really meant the _opposite_ (emphasis mine):

> “**If I had a Nicole** for every mistake I’ve made in life, I could retire,” Powell’s email to a reporter said. “Wish I had you as a proofreader at 1 a.m.”

> “In addition, counsel had internet and computer problems that delayed our communications, in addition to what can only be called ‘operator errors’ by lead counsel late night that caused the omission of the list of authorities and a substantive misstatement thoughtfully identified by CNBC this morning, which the contemporaneously filed brief corrects,” Powell wrote.

[^algorithms]: The _really_ sophisticated ones that count things.
