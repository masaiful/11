[Tech Yaks ranks and lists good tech talks](https://techyaks.com/all-all-tytop.html). 

Some awesome stuff on there, like [one of my favorite talks ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0) by [Guy Steele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_L._Steele_Jr.). ["_Fork Yeah! The Rise and Development of illumos_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc) by [Bryan Cantrill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cantrill), the second-most popular one on the list, is very entertaining and needs to be watched many times (and at 0.75x speed.)
