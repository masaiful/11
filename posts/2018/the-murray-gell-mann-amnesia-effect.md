title: The Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect

> You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.
>
> In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

> That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I’d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of _falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus_, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all.
>
> But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn’t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.

Okay, but a paper can publish [an article on Gravitational Waves](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/science/ligo-gravitational-waves-black-holes-einstein.html) authored by someone with a [background in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Overbye) on the same day as an article on [makeup in the movies](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/movies/oscars-2016-100-year-old-man-makeup.html) by a [veteran showbiz reporter](https://www.nytimes.com/by/mekado-murphy). Maybe I'm cherrypicking and he's talking about the average overall quality. That being said, I do know that I wouldn't have any MGM amnesia after reading, say, the _The National Enquirer_'s offerings on either topic.
