Made [a "Literary Clock"](https://public.nikhil.io/literary-clock/index.html) inspired by [Jaap Meijer's](http://www.eerlijkemedia.nl/) [repurposing of an old Kindle](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/). Might not be a bad use for an old iPad. Reminds me that I need to get [Mark Formanek's _Standard Time_](http://www.standard-time.com/about_en.php) onto a Raspberry Pi at some point.

<span class="update">08/24/18</span> There's [an app](http://www.standard-time.com/iapp_de.php) (of course)
