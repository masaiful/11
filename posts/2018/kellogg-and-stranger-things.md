From a [Bloomberg article on frozen food](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-11/frozen-food-makes-unlikely-comeback-in-heyday-of-quinoa-and-kale):

> After a four-year slump, Kellogg Co., maker of Special K and Frosted Flakes, has returned to growth in recent quarters. That’s thanks in part to a boost from Eggos, which benefited from its prominence in the hit Netflix series "Stranger Things" as the favorite food of a mysterious telekinetic girl named Eleven. The brand’s sales are up double digits in each of the last two quarters.
