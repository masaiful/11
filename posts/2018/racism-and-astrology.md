Via co-worker DH. [Dara Ã“ Briain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_%C3%93_Briain) on how Racism is better than Astrology:

> Racism is one of the worst social evils they can imagine. "How dare you do that?" they say. "How dare you ascribe to me personality traits? You don't even know me, but you _tell_ me that you know me, and you know these things about me, and you say I share these personality traits with this huge group of people, and I don't know them, you don't know them, and you say not only do we have the same character traits, but we have some sort of common history and some common destiny, and you make all of these _horrible_ presumptions on the back of what? On the back of a fluke of birth. How dare you do that?

> What? Ooh, Capricorn.
