[ExecutedToday.com](http://www.executedtoday.com) has been publishing "the story of an historical execution that took place on this date, and the story behind it" since October 2007. 

> The death penalty, as a subset within that vast category of “acts of violence homo sapiens do to their fellows,” blends insensibly into a dozen adjacent territories — murder, assassination, warfare, torture, low crime and high statecraft, even suicide.

That being said, it does not aim to be "an all-purpose chronicle of human cruelty."

Because Internet. [And why not, really](http://www.executedtoday.com/cards/)?
