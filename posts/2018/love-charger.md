This is insane:

> **Chauhan**: One day the Guru summoned a meeting of his closest male devotees. There were about 400 to 500 people. He said "We are going to remove your virility. After that, your mind isn't going to wander. You'll come closer to God."
>
> **Narrator**: Chauhan says he didn't understand that the Guru was talking about castration.
>
> [. . .]
>
> **Chauhan**: Guru had put a lot of property under the names of castrated devotees. He knew that we would never get married or have children. When we died, we would leave the property here and he would put his name on our Power of Attorney.
