> Mr. Thomas and the photographer Emily Shur rented a home in Los Angeles for a weekend in May. There, they shot several images that harked back to Mr. Rockwell’s “Freedom From Want,” one in a series of four paintings inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1941 speech to Congress celebrating America’s freedom and democratic values.
>
> "The image haunted me because of the world we live in," the artist said, referring to today’s divisive political climate. "I wanted to imagine what it would look like today."
