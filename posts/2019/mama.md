_For My Mother_ by [May Sarton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Sarton)

> Once more
> I summon you
> Out of the past
> With poignant love,
> You who nourished the poet
> And the lover.
> I see your gray eyes
> Looking out to sea
> In those Rockport summers,
> Keeping a distance
> Within the closeness
> Which was never intrusive
> Opening out
> Into the world.
> And what I remember
> Is how we laughed
> Till we cried
> Swept into merriment
> Especially when times were hard.
> And what I remember
> Is how you never stopped creating
> And how people sent me
> Dresses you had designed
> With rich embroidery
> In brilliant colors
> Because they could not bear
> To give them away
> Or cast them aside.
> I summon you now
> Not to think of
> The ceaseless battle
> With pain and ill health,
> The frailty and the anguish.
> No, today I remember
> The creator,
> The lion-hearted.
