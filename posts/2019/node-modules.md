For a single project I made the mistake of working on in my Dropbox folder:

![](/misc/d/dropbox_node_modules.jpg)

Wonder what the downsides are to [hardlinking by default](https://pnpm.js.org/). And, fundamentally, why creating an amazing, Python-like standard library is such an intractable problem in the first place.

> [. . .]‚Ää`core-js` is also utils library, quite a big one honestly! It has so many functions inside I bet a lot of other packages will be using it!
>
> Not really. Only `babel-runtime` has it in its deps. _Oopsie_.
And returning to the starting point, `cli` uses only 3 (trivial) methods from common-tags‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää`stripIndents`, `stripIndent`, `oneLine`. _Oopsie daisy_.
>
> **In order to use these 3 methods `node_modules` needs 1826 files. And that‚Äôs just 4 of mentioned 976 installed packages.**

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The portion of the article that listed functionally similar packages and `is-*` packages was particularly dismaying. As he points out, there's a good reason why jQuery and lodash are as immensely popular as they are[^neocities].
