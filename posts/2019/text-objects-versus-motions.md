Excellent talk by [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/writing/an-incremental-approach-to-vim/) on [Mastering the Vim Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0). Features a lot of must-read Vim resources and nice-to-have plugins. Key takeaway for me: _Prefer text objects to motions when possible_ (corollary: "Is this repeatable?")
