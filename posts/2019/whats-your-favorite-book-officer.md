In [_Ramayya Vasthavayya_](https://youtu.be/gTLhFllz8OA?t=5251), Avinash is a mononymous "Central Crime Branch" officer who, according to the barcode on his IDENTITY CARD, loves [new-agey mind meld books](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781411686915). Or so [I gather](http://www.naphill.org/focus-instructors/mastermind/). Couldn't decipher the other barcode but submit that it might reveal his preference for reasonably priced cutlery sets at Bed Bath & Beyond.
