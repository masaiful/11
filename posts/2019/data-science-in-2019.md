[Vicki Boykis' excellent article](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different/) on every aspect of 'Data Science' I can think of: a little history, employment prospects, skills, education, and continuous learning.

It would appear that more than half the job, at least, is wrangling (replicating, cleaning, imputing, transferring, understanding, augmenting) _data_. It's boring and [super-important](https://veekaybee.github.io/2019/05/10/java8/) so, of course, is the least favorite thing ðŸ™ƒ
