Found screenshots of a [beautiful vintage theme](http://thednetworks.com/2012/02/23/retro-iphone-theme-of-the-the-80s-if-iphone-was-available-in-the-80s-this-it-what-it-would-look-like/) I'd installed on my iPhone 5 via [Cydia](https://pangu8.com/cydia/) when I was stupid enough to jailbreak my phone. Wish I could still use it though üòç
