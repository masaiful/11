> The study found that for the entire group of participants, cuter creatures were associated with greater activity in brain areas involved in emotion. But the more cute aggression a person felt, the more activity the scientists saw in the brain's reward system.

That suggests people who think about squishing puppies appear to be driven by two powerful forces in the brain. "It's not just reward and it's not just emotion," Stavropoulos says. "Both systems in the brain are involved in this experience of cute aggression."

The combination can be overwhelming. And scientists suspect that's why the brain starts producing aggressive thoughts. The idea is that the appearance of these negative emotions helps people get control of the positive ones running amok.

"It could possibly be that somehow these expressions help us to just sort of get it out and come down off that baby high a little faster," says [Oriana Arag√≥n](https://www.clemson.edu/business/about/profiles/OARAGON), an assistant professor at Clemson University who was part of the Yale team that gave cute aggression its name.
