> Back in the second century BC, Cato the Elder ended his speeches with the phrase '_Carthago delenda est_,' which is to say, 'Carthage must be destroyed.' It didn't matter what the ostensible topic of the speech was: above all, Carthage must be destroyed.
> 
> My opinion towards JavaScript is much like Cato's towards Carthage: it must be rooted out, eliminated and destroyed entirely. I don't know if I'd go _quite_ so far as to say that the fundamental challenge of mass computing is the final destruction of JavaScript â€” but I _want_ to say it, even though it's false.

> JavaScript is a pox, a disaster, a shame. It is the most embarrassingly bad thing to become popular in computing since Windows 3.1. Its one virtue (that it's on every client device) is outshone by its plethora of flaws in much the same way that a matchstick is outshone by the sun, the stars and the primordial energy of the Big Bang added together.

> JavaScript is the XML, the [Yugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugo), the [Therac-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25) of programming languages. The sheer amount of human effort which has been expended working around its fundamental flaws instead of advancing the development of mankind is astounding. The fact that people would take this paragon of wasted opportunity and use it on the server side, where there are so many better alternatives (to a first approximation, _every other programming language ever used_), is utterly appalling.

I don't know what my newfound affection for it says about me. Via [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11447851).
