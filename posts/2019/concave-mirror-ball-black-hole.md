[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e-LZPHBA2M&feature=youtu.be&t=122) of a ball swinging in front of concave mirror (starts at 2:00, cannot embed for some reason) reminded me of simulations of [what it would be like](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16885-what-would-it-look-like-to-fall-into-a-black-hole/) if one fell into a Black Hole.

Here's a Schwarzschild Black Hole, one "with mass, but with no electric charge, and no spin." ([Source](https://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/schw.html))
