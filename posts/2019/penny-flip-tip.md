> Whenever you’re called on to make up your mind, <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; and you’re hampered by not having any, <br/>
> the best way to solve the dilemma, you’ll find, <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; is simply by spinning a penny. <br/>
> No—not so that chance shall decide the affair <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; while you’re passively standing there moping; <br/>
> but the moment the penny is up in the air, <br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp; you suddenly know what you’re hoping. <br/>
