> In programming, it is also common to refer to the "NIH syndrome" as the tendency towards [reinventing the wheel](/posts/a2b2c761cdb55d65bbf95c86edc4033f/) (reimplementing something that is already available) based on the belief that in-house developments are inherently better suited, more secure, more controlled, quicker to develop, and incur lower overall cost (including maintenance cost) than using existing implementations. In-house developments are often collaborative with each other. When two in-house developments come together, it is informally known as "computer incest."
