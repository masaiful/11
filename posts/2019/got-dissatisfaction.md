> My anger has never been with the writers for having a character I love to come to a tragic end like that. No matter how gut-wrenching it was, they, or George RR Martin, always laid out a convincing argument for why it happened. And that's what great writing does, it makes you think of the downfalls as being a result of the characters actions or a clear set of events.

> For Ned, he went from Point A - being hand of the king, to point B - getting beheaded and his family being torn apart. No matter how devastating though, it was set up and executed perfectly. From the moment he figured our Cersei's children were by Jaime and not Bobby B, the things he did, the decisions he made, led to his death. We as viewers know that he made a critical mistake in telling Cersei that he knew. In trusting and underestimating Littlefinger. And lastly with Sansa and himself trusting that Joffrey would keep his word in being merciful if Ned admitted treason. **It is why when the end of Episode 9 happened, no one was talking about how bad the writers were. Our frustrations were with Ned, our anger was with Joffrey and Cersei. It is not that he deserved to get killed, it is that we have a full understanding of how he got there. There is no arguing against that progression.**

> And most importantly this moment hits us with what was the hard truth of the show the characters, no matter how much we love them, will suffer the consequences of their actions.

And finally, and I've watched this a few times with unhealthy glee, Screen Rant [on how the HBO Season 8 pitch meeting might have gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhKOV3nImQ) (via CM.)

Season 8 was a stark reminder[^stark_reminder] of George RR Martin's writing prowess[^martin_got_s8].

[^martin_got_s8]: Even if he has to [imprison himself in a small cabin to finish things](https://io9.gizmodo.com/george-r-r-martin-just-set-a-very-peculiar-winds-of-wi-1834953464).
[^stark_reminder]: Unoriginal and lame but couldn't resist.
