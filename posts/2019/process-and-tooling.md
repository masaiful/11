> I thought using loops was cheating, so I programmed my own using samples. I then thought using samples was cheating, so I recorded real drums. I then thought that programming it was cheating, so I learned to play drums for real. I then thought using bought drums was cheating, so I learned to make my own. I then thought using premade skins was cheating, so I killed a goat and skinned it. I then thought that that was cheating too, so I grew my own goat from a baby goat. I also think that is cheating, but I’m not sure where to go from here. I haven’t made any music lately, what with the goat farming and all.

I've made this mistake all too often, _especially_ when trying to learn something new.

Things that quote kinda reminds me of:

* The old ["_Hole in My Bucket_" song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_a_Hole_in_My_Bucket) (here's [a version by Odetta and Harry Belafonte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AthT8kw7CIo).)
* "[For Want of a Nail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Want_of_a_Nail)"
* This classic from "_Malcolm in the Middle_"
