Was looking try something other than my beloved [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles) and came across [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) which claims to be a "rather special coding font." I _love_ it. Looks like the cooler twin of [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata). I remain quite tickled by how many of my co-workers find the italic variants of monospaced fonts 'disturbing' when they look at my screen.
