> Mountains should be climbed with as little effort as possible and
without desire. The reality of your own nature should determine the
speed. If you become restless, speed up. If you become winded, slow
down. You climb the mountain in an equilibrium between restlessness and
exhaustion. Then, when you're no longer thinking ahead, each footstep
isn't just a means to an end but a unique event in itself. This leaf has
jagged edges. This rock looks loose. From this place the snow is less
visible, even though closer. These are things you should notice anyway.
To live only for some future goal is shallow. It's the sides of the
mountain which sustain life, not the top. Here's where things grow.

-- Robert M. Pirsig, "_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_"
