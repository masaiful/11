I could watch this one for hours and might just loop it [on the old iPad](/posts/a6f9fca187a7559ca99e3f3744254287). It's called "_Walking City_".

From 2016. I wonder how long this would take to render on the latest and greatest graphics card (an [nVidia RTX 2080 Ti](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080-ti/) that sells for $1,200.)
