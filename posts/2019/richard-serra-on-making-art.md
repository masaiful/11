> **Q**: Why make art? What do you find by _doing_ it? What does it _get_ you?

> **Serra**: I always wanted an alternative existence. And by that I mean I wanted to do something where I could study my own sentiments and experiences. And I found that I can do that in relation to making things and making art in particular. And I did that since I was a kid it was a place I always could go to that I could concentrate and deal with the problems that I thought were of interest to me. And if I was clear enough about what it was that I was probing,
and stayed with the premise of I was probing, it was possible that it could also be clear to someone else, and it was important that it not be something that somebody else has done.

That's from [a recording](/misc/s/serra.m4a) at the SF MoMA. I first heard [of him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Serra) after moving to Des Moines and seeing his "[_Five Plate Pentagon_](https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/public-artwork/five-plate-pentagon/)" at [our beautiful sculpture park](https://dsmpublicartfoundation.org/all-art/?wpv-pr-child-of%5B%5D=0&wpv-pr-child-of%5B%5D=198&wpv_aux_current_post_id=4534&wpv_view_count=4539-TCPID4534).
