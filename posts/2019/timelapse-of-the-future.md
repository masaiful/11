Best thing I've seen this year. About as spiritual as it gets.

> After an unimaginable length of time, even the black holes will have evaporated and the universe will be nothing but a sea of photons, gradually tending towards the same temperature, as the expansion of the universe cools them towards absolute zero. Once the very last remnants of the very last stars are finally decayed away to nothing and everything reaches the same temperature, the story of the universe finally comes to an end. For the first time in its life, the Universe will be permanent and unchanging. Entropy finally stops increasing because the cosmos cannot get any more disordered.

> Nothing happens. And it keeps not happening forever.

ðŸ˜¢ how _beautiful_ is that? And black holes take a [long, long time to evaporate](https://www.space.com/34281-do-black-holes-die.html)

> A black hole with the mass of the sun will last a wizened 10<sup>67</sup> years. Considering that the current age of our universe is a paltry 13.8 times 10<sup>9</sup> years, that's a good amount of time. But if you happened to turn the Eiffel Tower into a black hole, it would evaporate in only about a day.

And that's after [this happens](https://medium.com/starts-with-a-bang/when-will-the-first-star-go-dark-927801efd23f)

> It will take hundreds of trillions of years for the first stellar remnant to cool completely, fading from a white dwarf through red, infrared and all the way down to a true black dwarf. By that point, the Universe will hardly be forming any new stars at all, and space will be mostly black.

BLN and I spoke about how we simply have [no good strategy](https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-to-comprehend-incomprehensibly-large-numbers-1531604757) to attempt a comprehension of "hundreds of trillions" of years.
