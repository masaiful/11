[_All Yesterdays_](https://smile.amazon.com/All-Yesterdays-Speculative-Dinosaurs-Prehistoric-ebook/dp/B00A2VS55O) is an exploration of things [we know we will never know](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/rumsfelds-knowns-and-unknowns-the-intellectual-history-of-a-quip/359719/) about "dinosaurs and prehistoric animals" . Jonathan Wojcik at bogleech.com has an [excellent review](http://bogleech.com/allyesterdays.html) of the book. Of particular interest: We know little-to-nothing about the creatures' anatomies and morphologies because of missing soft tissue data. Here are paleoartists' recreations of a cow and a swan:

Looked up a sperm whale's skeleton and can't imagine how lacking a recreation would be:

[This article](https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/pdfs/comment_palaeoart.pdf) discusses the history and current state of paleoart. And [this post](http://bogleech.tumblr.com/post/99186085698/as-cm-kosemen-explains-throughout-all) is the ultimate TL;DR on the subject

> As C.M. Kosemen explains throughout All Yesterdays, we really can’t ever know how much fat and other soft tissues contributed to the overall shape of dinosaurs since that’s the first thing to rot and shrivel tight against their bones and like even a sperm whale has a little skinny skeleton.
