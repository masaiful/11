[A list of sub-genres you cannot view easily on Netflix](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/netflix-codes-secret-numbers-unlock-1000s-hidden-films-tv-shows/). From [a Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestofnetflix/comments/cwf7fn/the_full_netflix_secret_codes/eyappk2/) on the subject:

> This is ridiculous. What kind of hubris does Netflix have to think that their recommendation engine is better than browsing by category? Browsing by category has been the standard for browsing things since categories of things has existed. Some VP of product made his bonus by convincing someone that his ML team could do better. "Yeah, just remove it and let us populate 15 movies randomly in a whimsical fictitious category like 'movies with dogs and music'. People will love it."

and

> Because the studios pay Netflix (via discounted licensing) for favorable placement on those “recommended viewing” lists.
>
> Always follow the money.
