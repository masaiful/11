[The Des Moines Register](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/) on how to send them email in (I'm guessing) the late 80s/early 90s.

An article on how Baud Rate isn't the same as Bit Rate

> Baud rate refers to **the number of signal or symbol changes that occur per second**. A symbol is one of several voltage, frequency, or phase changes. NRZ binary has two symbols, one for each bit 0 or 1, that represent voltage levels. In this case, the baud or symbol rate is the same as the bit rate.
