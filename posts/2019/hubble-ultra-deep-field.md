One of my favorite things in the world.

> Located southwest of Orion in the southern-hemisphere constellation Fornax, the rectangular image is 2.4 arcminutes to an edge, or 3.4 arcminutes diagonally. This is approximately _one tenth of the angular diameter of a full moon viewed from Earth_ (which is less than 34 arcminutes), _smaller than 1 sq. mm piece of paper held at 1 meter away_, and equal to roughly one twenty-six-millionth of the total area of the sky. The image is oriented so that the upper left corner points toward north (−46.4°) on the celestial sphere.

Here's all that in video form

The best screensaver in the world using red-shift data

And a [very high-resolution image](https://public.nikhil.io/hudf.jpg) (> 60MB). [Wallpapers are available](https://robservatory.com/a-new-set-of-hubble-deep-space-imac-retina-desktops/).

Our shit is so, so, _so_ tiny.

> There are over 100 billion galaxies in the universe. Simply saying that number doesn't really mean much to us because it doesn't provide any context. Our brains have no way to accurately put that in any meaningful perspective. When we look at this image, however, and think about the context of how it was made and really understand what it means, we instantly gain the perspective and cannot help, but be forever changed by it.

Not so sure about "instantly" gaining perspective but the rest about wonder and curiosity and our insignificant place the heavens still stand.
