Brilliant. I love both the presence and contents of the `Dockerfile` in that repo. As is always the case with such projects, the [issues](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acomments-desc) are ðŸ’¯

And if one _is_ tempted to go against the tenets of No Code, there's always my beloved [fuckitpy](https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy), a (strangely well-thought-out) "Python error steamroller"[^fuckitjs]:

```python
@fuckit
def buggy_function():
    problem_solved

@fuckit
class BuggyClass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        everything_works_now
```

And:

> This module is like violence: if it doesn't work, you just need more of it.
