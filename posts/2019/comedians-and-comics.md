From an episode of [_My Next Guest with David Letterman_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80209096):

> <span class="small-caps">Letterman</span>: First of all, let's define terms. Comedian and comic: used interchangeably but mean two different things.
>
> <span class="small-caps">Seinfeld</span>: Kind of different, yeah. A comedian is a, to me, a full-fledged, not only a monologist, but someone who can really work a room, work a crowd and has a real act. A comic... that, I think, is a notch down. Wouldn't you agree?
>
> <span class="small-caps">Letterman</span>: Well, you're assigning value to them.
>
> <span class="small-caps">Seinfeld</span>: Yes.
>
> <span class="small-caps">Letterman</span>: I thought they were two different pursuits. That a comedian was somebody who would be funny on stage, in a theatrical production, or in film, something like that, whereas a comic would be more like what you've made a career of.
>
> <span class="small-caps">Seinfeld</span>: Oh, no, no, no. You're talking about a comedic actor. Jackie Gleason was not a comic. He started out as a comic but he was a great _comedic actor_. Ten Danson is a great comedic actor, but he's not a comedian. He has no _act_ to do in Vegas. Which is the objective.
>
> <span class="small-caps">Letterman</span>: So you're saying that a comedian... but I don't understand why there is a judgment assigned to being a comic.
>
> <span class="small-caps">Seinfeld</span>: Just because we like judging others, that's the reason.
