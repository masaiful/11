Confirmation that I did, indeed, see a "No, Georgia the _country_, idiot" flag. And then there's this surprising tidbit:

> The flags of Canada, Cuba, Georgia, India, Israel, South Korea, and South Vietnam were spotted in the mob. It’s unclear why many of these flags appeared, though a number of the white supremacist and militia groups that were present have international chapters.
