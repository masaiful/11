It would appear that I'm _far_ from done [collecting this batshittery](/tags/shitkraken). 

> "==Gondor has no king==," [the lawsuit states](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1120287/gov.uscourts.txwd.1120287.6.0.pdf), a footnote providing an explanation of the woeful fate of ==Tolkien’s entirely imaginary land== populated by dragons, ==wizards==, hobbits and elves, all threatened by a baleful Dark Lord backed up by an army of orcs and ==with famously little time for due democratic process==.
> 
> The suit explains how Gondor’s throne was empty and its rightful kings in exile, presumably positing the idea that Trump is the true king of ==America – a land happily monarch-free since 1776==.
> 
> "This analogy is applicable since there is now in Washington DC a group of individuals calling themselves the president, vice-president and Congress who have no rightful claim to govern the American people," the case states.
> 
> It adds: "==Since only the rightful king could sit on the throne of Gondor, a steward was appointed to manage Gondor until the return of the King, known as ‘Aragorn’, occurred at the end of the story.=="
> 
> The lawsuit then suggests that ==America’s version of the stewards of Gondor should be selected from among – surprise, surprise – Trump’s cabinet members==, who should run the country.

Nope. [Not delusional _at all_](/misc/h/he-is-lying.jpg).
