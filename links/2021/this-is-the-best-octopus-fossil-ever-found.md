It was found in 1982 in France. It's 165M years old. Researchers reconstructed it in 3D using "synchrotron microtomography." I was unable this reconstruction because the system of scientific journals is [a money-grubbing bullshit system run by greedy people](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/6/3/18271538/open-access-elsevier-california-sci-hub-academic-paywalls). Here she is though ♥️
