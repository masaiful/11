Not sure if this has to do with The Client's legendary ethics and history of non-payment ([one](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/), [two](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454), [three](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/donald-trump-police-cities-bills-maga-rallies/), [four](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/trump-rallies-unpaid-bills-039631), [five](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/city-leaders-trump-pay-your-bills-help-us-fight-coronavirus-n1184646), and [many](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/09/07/usa-freedom-kids-trump-lawsuit/89953682/), [many](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/dc/president-trump-wont-pay-for-minneapolis-rally-still-owes-dc-9million/65-012b6e66-8942-44fb-b4a1-6229b69afe18) more) or the Strike Force's [whopping 1.5% success rate](/links/fd057dfadd3d5bf8af528e76524d5f86/). Or maybe The Genius _finally_ realized:

> “Your typical role as legal counselor is to tell your client the hard truth and walk them away from risk,” Matthew Sanderson, a Republican political lawyer based in Washington, said in an interview. “Rudy instead seems to tell his client exactly what he wants to hear and walk him toward risk like they’re both moths to a flame.”
