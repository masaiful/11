I don't think I've glowed _this_ much at an article's title in a while.

> Here is a list of [harmful nonsense](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/ajit-pai) Pai and his FCC did over the last four years:
>
> * Killed net neutrality
> * Approved T-Mobile / Sprint merger
> * Repeatedly released reports that claimed U.S. broadband is fine
> * Defended murder of net neutrality in court
> * Flubbed Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response
> * Slow-walked and obstructed investigation into telecom company sale of your location data
> * Said FTC would protect net neutrality (it didn’t, and couldn’t)
> * Falsely claimed killing net neutrality was good for broadband access (it wasn’t)
> * Refused to brief Congress about telecom companies’ sale of their customers’ phone location data

> Those 25Mbps / 3Mbps speeds aren’t even minimums, by the way, because the Annual Broadband Report isn’t something meant to be enforced. It’s a benchmark by which the FCC determines whether it’s doing its job of helping to close the digital divide — where [as many as 1 in 3 US households don’t have broadband internet access at all](https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc). Currently, if a single ISP claims it can deliver a single 25Mbps down / 3Mbps up internet connection _anywhere in your entire census block_, much less your home, the FCC considers its job done. Oh, and the FCC doesn’t even audit those numbers! It’s a “[fox guarding the henhouse” kind of thing](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition).
