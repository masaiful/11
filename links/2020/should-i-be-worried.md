is a simple and aptly-named COVID tracker that uses [data from Johns Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). As of September 1^st^ 2020, my state of Iowa is #1 (woohoo!) with a 7-day infection rate of 261/100,000 people ("_there might be 2 to 6 times as many recent infections_") and **an R~0~ rate of 1.7**. "_Over the past 30 days, 246 people in Iowa have died of Covid-19. If Iowa remains on its current trajectory, expect to see more than three times as many deaths from Covid-19 over the next 30 days._" That'll show 'em.
