title: Every "safety plan" I've seen that would allow public schools to reopen requires that kids behave in ways that no child has ever behaved in the history of children.

Yep. And the tweet was in the context of school openings, but [college towns](/misc/n/notre-dame-closed.html) like Ames and Iowa City, are no exceptions (like [she continues](https://twitter.com/girlziplocked/status/1290040337423982592).) I say _we_ continue to doubt the science, exercise absolutely no discipline in the interest of the economy (because [the Communist Kiwis](/misc/n/new-zealand-covid.html) maintain zero interest in restoring theirs as quickly as possible), yell at people who wear masks, fight Big Government telling us what to do, expect maturity and restraint from children and teenagers, _have no bloody plan_, defend our effete leaders who institute [weak](/misc/d/dsm-face-masks.html) policies that are [too little](/misc/k/kim-bars.html) and [too late](/misc/k/kim-reynolds-bar-close.jpg), control the numbers and the narrative, and just [continue to be awesome](/misc/i/iowa-covid.html) ♥️ [That'll show 'em](/misc/r/republicans-covid-numbers.html). We're only [_beginning_ to get tired of winning](/misc/a/ames-worst-outbreak.html) folks.
