It's priced at $475 for the basic model and $800 for a deluxe version. [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5492ZjivAQ0) is very satisfying to watch (I couldn't have picked better background music.) 

One could start with a [Brachiograph](https://www.brachiograph.art/) for around $20 (basic Raspberry Pi setup, soldering skills, and assembly required.)
