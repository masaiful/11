> "[Cruz] has proven himself neither to be a genius in terms of the law nor a genius, frankly, in terms of [emotional intelligence]. He is a sad sack," Shapiro, a Democrat, told CNN. "I would say to him — and, frankly, I'd say to my 17 colleagues who have gone along with this circus — I don't know whether I need to send you a surgeon to examine your spine or a psychiatrist to examine your head. But something's wrong with you if you continue to follow this president."

Whatever. I think the Senator would be a lovely and strategic addition to the already Elite-as-_fuck_ Strike Force Team.
