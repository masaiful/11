Decent thriller. Cannot get over the fact that the [antagonist's makeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOUjzx7_Nzw) was awful and kept reminding me of the coconut and turmeric [_Varalakshmi Puja_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varalakshmi_Vratam) heads from my childhood [^jivaro_heads].

Which looks like this in a cheap wig

[^jivaro_heads]: Which, in turn, remind me of [Jivaro shrunken heads](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-does-one-actually-shrink-a-head-5994665/).
