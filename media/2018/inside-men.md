Longer than it should've been and unevenly paced. Predictable ending. Still very enjoyable, since I'm a sucker for a good vengeance flick. [Lee Byung-hun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Byung-hun) was absolutely fantastic (first saw him in "_[I Saw The Devil](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588170/)_".) Found myself hating [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baek_Yoon-sik)'s character with the same bile as Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge.
