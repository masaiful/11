Michael Cavna at _The Washington Post_ with [a roundup of the cultural appropriation controversy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2018/03/23/isle-of-dogs-cultural-appropriation-debate-marks-a-major-shift-in-how-we-watch-movies/?utm_term=.cd780a3ccee5) around the movie. Steve Rose at [_The Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/26/steve-rose-on-film-isle-of-dogs):

> Some critics are barking “appropriation!” on Twitter and online, but where _Ghost in the Shell_ and _Doctor Strange_ (and there are many more) took a Japanese story and cut-and-pasted in white people, here Anderson engages with Japanese culture and references on an almost scholarly level, while the cast is filled with Japanese names[^1], from Ken Watanabe to Yôjirô Noda, lead singer of Radwimps to, er, Yoko Ono.
>
> Isle of Dogs is a movie that seems custom-made to set off appropriation dog whistles but, for all its questionable moves, the result is a story that’s one of a kind. If we police boundaries too strictly, we’re stifling the possibility of cross-fertilisation and invention. If you do it well enough, it’s not appropriation, it’s conversation.

Also from that article: ["cultural Pinterestism"](/static/d/darling_melchitt.jpg).

I can watch stop-motion "making of" videos all day and here's a dismayingly short one on _Isle of Dogs_:

[The sushi scene took 8 _months_ to craft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBa2_Q-ciI0)!

[^1]: Numbers alone aren't compelling arguments but I counted 26 Japanese actors out of 49 [on the (partial?) cast list here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast)
