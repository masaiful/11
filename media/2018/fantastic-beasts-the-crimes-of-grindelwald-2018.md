[Dan Fogler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Fogler) is as awesome in this one as he was in the first. A role he was born to play:

> **Did you feel like you had an advantage while auditioning because you're actually from New York?**
> 
> I think I brought some real authenticity to it. I grew up in Brooklyn. When I read the part, I thought, "Oh, man,  I know this guy. He's one of my ancestors." I have a great-grandfather, Isaac, who was a baker in New York on the Lower East Side. It's really surreal stepping into the role. I felt like it was written for me. I felt like he was family already, so I loved him.
> 
> Then I paid homage to a lot of my favorite actors from that era, like Chaplin and Buster Keaton. When Eddie and I are together, it's like Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello. I tried to infuse him with all of that great, elegant kind of comedy, that real physical kind of comedy. Also [James] Cagney. I liked how Cagney stood. He was very conservative in his motions -- because I'm such a broad, wacky guy, I thought that it helped me stay in the period. Cut to me flailing and running like a maniac. [Laughs.]
