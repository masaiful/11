TL;DW? Denzel Washington is Liam Neeson from _Taken_ (with a _lot_ of [that movie's tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Taken).) Over on Reddit, an essential discussion of [who would win a fight](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2qhwc5/denzel_washington_the_equalizer_vs_liam_neeson/). Features my favorite hipster-henchman, [Tait Fletcher](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1324884/) whom I last saw in _The Accountant_.

Loved the first half of this song:
