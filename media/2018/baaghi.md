Terrible. Expected this, so not sure why I did this to myself. Thought it was a weird mashup of [_Varsham_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsham_(2004_film)) and [_Dredd_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredd). Features this '[Grandmaster Shifuji](https://shifuji.in/truth-of-grandmaster-shifuji-shaurya-bharadwaj-that-every-indian-should-know/)' who attempts to act like a Kung Fu/[Kalari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalaripayattu) master in the movie and a combat veteran and "special forces trainer" in real life.

Watching what they did to [Sunil Grover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Grover) and [Sanjay Mishra](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0592799/?ref_=tt_cl_t12)'s talents was depressing. As for [Kota Srinivasa Rao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota_Srinivasa_Rao): they used a North Indian voice actor to dub over his South Indian accent... with a ghastly South Indian accent üòê 

Just terrible.
