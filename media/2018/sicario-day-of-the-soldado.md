> This is the jingoistic view of American force so familiar from films like 'Black Hawk Down.' This is American power as an unstoppable beast.

[Yep](/static/r/ron_swanson_america.gif).

> You would be forgiven for asking what religious extremists have to do with a film series that previously focused on Mexican drug cartels. You would also be forgiven for finding this film problematic as it focuses next on a craven terrorist attack in a grocery store. Three suicide bombers enter the crowded building and commit mass murder. We are not spared the image of a mother begging for the life of her little girl. We discover that the terrorists are being smuggled across the border by the cartels. Two of our greatest enemies have now become one.

-- Joshua Ruth [_"Sicario: Day of The Soldadoâ€™ is Violent, Problematic and One of the Most Satisfying Sequels in Years"_](http://www.cultfollowing.co/reviews/review-sicario-day-of-the-soldado-is-violent-problematic-and-one-of-the-most-satisfying-sequels-in-years/)

Watch for a masterclass in tension, Benecio Del Toro being a badass again, and for Isabela Moner's excellent performance.
