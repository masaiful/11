[Visually impressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_Indian_films#Hindi), tedious, misogynist, Islamophobic shitshow. [Barkha Dutt has a great review](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/02/06/padmaavat-is-pure-misogyny-dressed-up-in-diamonds-and-drama/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4b5edbbf8c8d) (via AD.)
