Watched with Catherine. Dark, tense, predictable. Uashamed to admit that I thought [Logan Marshall-Green was Tom Hardy](/static/l/logan_marshall_hardy.jpg) for the duration of the movie (even after watching "_Upgrade_" ... must've been [the hair](/static/l/logan_m_g_mane.jpg).) Excellent stuff by [Lindsey Burdge](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2698115/?ref_=tt_cl_t11).
