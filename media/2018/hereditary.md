Deeply upsetting. One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Anthony Lane of _The New Yorker_ on [what gives it its potency](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/18/hereditary-delivers-a-new-kind-of-horror)

> Should you want to measure the psychological disturbance at work here, try comparing "_Hereditary_" with "_A Quiet Place._" That recent hit, for all its masterly shocks, is at bottom a reassuring film, introducing people who are beset by an external menace but more or less able to pull through because, as a team, they’re roped together with enough love to fight back. "_Hereditary_" is more perplexing. It has the nerve to suggest that the social unit is, by definition, self-menacing, and that the home is no longer a sanctuary but a crumbling fortress, under siege from within. That is why there are no doctors in Aster’s film, and no detectives, either, urgently though both are required; nor does a man of God arrive, as he does in "_The Exorcist_" (1973), to lay the anguish to rest. Nothing, in short, can help Annie, Steve, and the kids, and they sure can’t help themselves, stationed as they are inside their delicate doll’s house of a world. There is no family curse in this remarkable movie. The family is the curse.

The amazing Colin Stetson did [the soundtrack](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/colin-stetson-hereditary-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/) which is somehow even more unsettling than [Brian Reitzell's _Hannibal_](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/arts/television/hannibal-3-steps-to-tvs-scariest-soundtrack.html).

**Update** 25 Oct 2018: If [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpMx3Y_lYbO/?hl=en&taken-by=desmoinesartcenter) was a movie:
