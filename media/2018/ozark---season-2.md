As brutal, breathless, and excellent as the first season. [Julia Garner](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3400186/), [Lisa Emery](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0256318/), and [Janet McTeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_McTeer) FTW 🙌

> She’s in a much more vulnerable place. She’s really struggling and having an identity crisis because of her dad. With Season 2, I think you have a much deeper understanding why she behaves like she does. People always go, “Oh Ruth is such a badass character — how does it feel to play her?” And it’s much deeper than that. It’s more that she has no choice.

> [. . .] I don’t know if you remember, but I had that handbag. And I know it’s a prop, but it’s important because that’s Ruth — she wears something really ugly, but she’ll have the pink handbag she probably got at Walmart because she secretly wants a real leather pink bag. She wants nice things, and you realize this girl is a child.

TIL that they shot the series [in Atlanta](https://www.accessatlanta.com/entertainment/television/did-you-know-netflix-hit-ozark-filmed-these-atlanta-area-locations/JYauc3NJbn2VugRgabHFhL/).
