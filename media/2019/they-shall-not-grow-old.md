A masterpiece. Powerful and harrowing. Glad I stayed till the end of the credits.

> Still, the film doesn't hold back in its depiction of the brutality of trench combat, and how most British soldiers started seeing the war as a pointless effort the longer it dragged on. "The strongest opinion they would have had was, 'The German army's in Belgium and France, and we're coming over here to push them out because we're friends [with Belgium and France],'" Jackson said. "I don't think people could quite get their heads around why the British and the Germans were suddenly enemies." As the conflict winds down and more prisoners of war are taken, testimonial after testimonial in _They Shall Not Grow Old_ suggests that British soldiers saw little difference between themselves and their supposed adversaries.

> "They were dealing with the same hardships, eating the same crappy food, in the same freezing conditions, and they felt a sort of empathy," Jackson said. "They were there because their governments told them to be there." That empathy, mixed with a sense of futility, is what makes _They Shall Not Grow Old_ such a precise triumph. Jackson takes whatever amorphous ideas the average viewer might have about the First World War and uses real human experience to give them shape. As the film's hundred-year-old footage springs to life, each face—whether muddied, wearied, relieved, or overjoyed—suddenly belongs to a recognizable person again. It's both thrilling and humbling to witness.

> It was the greed of rich belligerents trying to get richer. W.E.B. Du Bois, the black writer and activist, said it was the competition over resource-rich colonies in Africa. It was a struggle between liberty and autocracy (although czarist Russia’s alliance with France and England undercut that argument). It was because mankind’s moral instincts—this was philosopher and pacifist Bertrand Russell’s view—lagged behind its material wealth. It was Germany’s psychological insecurity, triggered by Britain’s naval supremacy and the fear of Russia’s rising might. It was, simply, the insanity of the only carnivorous species that kills its own kind for no good reason.
