The first two-thirds are brilliant. As for Olivia Wilde and her riveting performance:

> [. . .] it's still good to see a cunning and capable actress rise above her usual projects, such as stupid fodder like _Tron_ or _Cowboys and Aliens_, or labels like "Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity of 2010."
>
> After _Enough_ and five _Death Wish_ movies, the revenge genre is not without its recurring clich√©s, many of which get defrosted and microwaved again in _A Vigilante_. The point, if there is one, is that "heinous criminal felonies are acceptable if they are justified by a woman driven beyond the limits of reason." As one battered wife says, "Every graveyard is full of people who didn't make it." The same is true of old movies gathering dust in Hollywood film vaults.
