Venom goes from evil alien mastermind who wants to take over the planet to Toothless in "_How to Train Your Dragon_" in about five minutes.

His new motivations make no sense whatsoever.

> But in the case of Venom, the action follows nothing. There’s no reason for Venom to risk his life because he doesn’t seem to care about people, and it’s never been his arc to learn about why caring for humanity is important. Venom is not about an alien symbiote coming to Earth and learning that people are worth saving. It’s about a cannibalistic, violent force who merges with a hapless shmuck and decides to stick around. Venom’s sacrifice means nothing because even if you buy that he’d be willing to save Earth, that’s different than being willing to die to save it.

[Honest Trailers on the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCcS8wrNZos). I suppose it's all forgiven if you make $0.9B. Of course there's a sequel. Of course I'll watch it.
