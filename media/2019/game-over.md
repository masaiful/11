Entertaining, very nicely done, two-hour long _desi_ "Black Mirror" episode[^presented_game_over]. [Taapsee Pannu](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3966456/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) was ðŸ’¯. You will want to hug [Vinodhini Vaidynathan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6678966/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm)'s character. Saw with Deepu and we wondered what makes Tamil directors so good at this genre.

[^presented_game_over]: "Presented" by Anurag Kashyap. Not sure what that means.
