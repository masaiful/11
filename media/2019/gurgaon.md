Captured [the city's many contrasts](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jul/04/gurgaon-life-city-built-private-companies-india-intel-google) quite well. Felt like I was watching [_Mirzapur_](/media/mirzapur) again. The excellent Pankaj Tripathi plays the same wealthy, powerful, morally bankrupt, declining patriarch as in the show. Pretty much the same deal if they'd cast a mannequin instead of Akshay Oberoi.
