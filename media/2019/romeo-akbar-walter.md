Completely predictable plot and twists, _ridiculous_ ending, cookiecutter songs (features [the laziest, _dullest_, 'You composed it the day before it was due didn't you?' _qawwali_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd4bL19dLM) I've ever heard.)

Fantastic cinematography. [Sikander Kher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikandar_Kher) is great. Got a lot of digital errands done whilst watching it, so there's that.
