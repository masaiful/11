Slow start but gets pretty exciting towards the end. I couldn't wait for Lynn to rid herself of her parasitic friends (especially the cloying Grace, played to perfection by [Eisaya Hosuwan](https://www.instagram.com/oomeisaya/?hl=en).) Cheating on standardized tests is big business in India and China. _The Atlantic_ has a [relatively recent article](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/how-sophisticated-test-scams-from-china-are-making-their-way-into-the-us/474474/) on the phenomenon.

The usual commentary on class and meritocracy. _Lots_ of love for Boston University.
