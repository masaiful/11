A great complement to [the book](/2018/06/bad-blood-secrets-and-lies-in-a-silicon-valley-startup/).

> When I think of Theranos, I really think that there were two entirely different worlds. There was the carpeted world and there was the tiled world. In the carpeted world where Elizabeth was a goddess. Everyone, you know, almost worshipped the ground she walked on. She could do no wrong. She was the next Steve Jobs. Theranos was changing the world. And then you go into the tiled side and nothing works. We're on a sinking ship. Everything is a lie. Reconciling the differences between those two worlds was really hard for me to do.
> 
> [...] I would leave the tiled world thinking, 'Oh man, sinking ship.' And I would go have one conversation with Elizabeth. And I would be so motivated to go back and work and I felt like I was changing the world again. And I would go back into the tiled world and I would go, 'Wait, what just happened?' You want it to be true so badly and even for me, I was working with these devices every single day and she could still kind of convince me. When I think back on those conversations, I just think 'How did she do that?'
