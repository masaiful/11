Moody and _plenty_ gruesome. Got tired of the commune's many 'rituals'. Florence Pugh is ðŸ’¯, as is [the creepy-ass soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/4rvusOWy00D4TQO0CxHGJK). Learned about [senicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senicide). First half is a bit of a slow burn like "[_Hereditary_](/media/hereditary/)".
