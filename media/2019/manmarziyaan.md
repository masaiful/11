Watched with Paaji. [Third](https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/bollywood/amit-trivedi-on-reuniting-with-anurag-kashyap-in-manmarziyaan-he-sets-me-free-from-all-my-inhibitions-5015941.html) Anurag Kashyap and Amit Trivedi film. Superb. Maybe a little too drawn out at times (gotta fit in all 14 tracks of that sweet Trivedi score) and was dismayingly _Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam_-predictable towards the end.

"[_Gray Waala Shade_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmW81VuDDbw)" (with the accompanying opening scenes) is a magnificent song[^manmarz_dariya][^pandp_shah].

[^manmarz_dariya]: Yes, yes, "[_Daryaa_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z_cClBsABE)" too.

[^pandp_shah]: [Kashyap saw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r86xnU0cXg) Poonam and Priyanka Shah [on this viral _Bharatnatyam_ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzAqCbxqAtA) before asking them to be part of the movie.
