The last 15 minutes are the best depiction of old age, loneliness, and isolation I've ever seen committed to film. Two masters at their very best.

I love all the memes about its length but (a) the pacing was brilliant and (b) I am someone who grew up watching [200-minute family-values extravaganzas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_Aapke_Hain_Koun..!) and can take it. [Still](/static/i/irishman.jpg).

Need to read up more [on the de-aging process they used in the film](https://www.wired.com/story/the-irishman-netflix-ilm-de-aging/).
