A slasher version of _A Quiet Place_ except The Monster gets you when you open your eyes (but _only_ at key moments that further the plot.) Snoozefest after the first half. Had no idea that the lanky, highly tattooed extra is [a famous rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Gun_Kelly_(rapper)). A few [plotholes](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a25684612/bird-box-netflix-questions/) that bugged me:

> What exactly constitutes a safe barrier between your vision and the outdoors? By the movie's standards, a thin-fabric blindfold and a sparse canopy of leaves count, but a security camera does not.

> How did [Trevante Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevante_Rhodes) manage to keep such a defined six-pack over the course of five home-bound years, and would he be willing to share that workout routine?

Elsewhere, _Gizmodo_ on [how the unseen monster is an allegory for the pernicious effects of social media](https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/bird-box-is-the-first-great-monster-movie-about-this-po-1831318490) on our lives. Huh.
