A wafer-thin afterthought of a plot undergirds an important and harrowing commentary on the history, pervasiveness, and evil of the caste system in India.

Excellent cinematography and performances by Ayushmann Khurrana, [Kumud Mishra](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1122912/?ref_=tt_cl_t5) as Jatav, and [Sushil Pandey](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3124900/?ref_=tt_cl_t9) as Nihal Singh.
