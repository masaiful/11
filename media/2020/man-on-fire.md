Watched because Denzel and Revenge. Not sure why I bothered finishing it. _Absolutely awful_. The cinematographer appears to have borrowed the ghastly verdigris-like palette from [this terribly photoshopped poster](https://static-log.nikhil.io/m/man-on-fire-poster.jpg), and keeps twitching the camera with the giddiness of a raver who's taken _two_ of those new [Mitsubishi pills](https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xykza/the-rise-and-fall-of-red-mitsubishis-the-ecstasy-pill-that-terrified-australia) they keep talking about.

Dakota Fanning is the only other reason to endure this. She was only ten in 2004 but acted like she'd been at it for at least three decades.
