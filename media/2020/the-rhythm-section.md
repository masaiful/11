Am a sucker for a good revenge story. This one was very slow and kinda haphazard. But I didn't think it was bad enough to deserve this:

> The film received negative reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb, having _the worst wide opening weekend of all-time, the biggest drop in theaters_, and is projected to lose Paramount $40 million.

Good _grief_ Basel! Blake Lively put in one of those "triumphant" performances 👏💯🏅
