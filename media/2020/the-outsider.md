Jason Bateman directed the first few episodes of this show and appears to be on a roll (saw this right after the third season of _Ozark_.) It was a 10-episode miniseries that was 5 episodes too long. Everything about the antagonist was either laughable or inconsistent. [Cynthia Erivo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Erivo) was magnificent as the wicked-smaht and quirky Holly Gibney whose savant-superpowers remained largely unused by the plot.
