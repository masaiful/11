Saw with CK. Excited because Charlie Kaufman. Mostly self-indulgent tripe. The conversations in the car were _interminably_ tedious[^not_the_point] and missing PBR hats and gauloises. The weirdness in the first third-to-a-half of the movie was excellent. Top-notch performances and camerawork.

[^not_the_point]: No, this is neither clever nor the point.
