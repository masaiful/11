Saw this after about 18 years. Some assorted notes: Thought I heard ["_BolÃ©ro_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yXttfmXqus). Every frame is a fucking painting. Just so wonderful: sunshine through the leaves and at the interrogation, characters walking into and out of the audience, [the gate's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj%C5%8Dmon) and state of decay, and of course Tajomaru's sword when he's under the tree ðŸ¤£ No idea what his constant fly-swatting signified. Faces sometimes resembled those in [_Ukiyo-e_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e) paintings (like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e#/media/File:Toshusai_Sharaku-_Otani_Oniji,_1794.jpg)). Save for the hapless priest, every character is demon and human. Storytelling: tension between whether it is to be regarded a fable or a real account. 'The lies we tell ourselves don't matter as long as they're in the service of mending and [preserving our humanity](https://www.wagingpeace.org/remember-your-humanity/).' Professor David Thorburn [breaks down the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B8FySbsUsM&t=1s).
