A beautiful story about my favorite alien told with phenomenally good camera work. Left me a bit misty-eyed[^octopus_cynic]. Lovely stuff.

[^octopus_cynic]: Felt like kicking myself for reading a [few comments about it on _Hacker News_](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24748738) later. Not sure why I did this but promised myself I'd stick to the topics that site is good for (empathy not being one of them.)
