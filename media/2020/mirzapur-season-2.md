A bit sloppy compared to the first season but still quite the entertainer (or maybe I just love the surfeit of bad language, of which there is _plenty_ ♥️)

Excellent stuff from the main cast, especially [Sheeba Chaddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheeba_Chaddha) and [Rasika Dugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasika_Dugal). 

But [Pankaj Tripathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankaj_Tripathi) could read the backs of shampoo bottles in 40-minute episodes and I'd still binge the 'show' and write encomiums about how good a performer he is.
