Another jingoistic [saffron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffronisation) shitshow a la "[_Padmaavat_](/media/padmaavat/)"[^tanhaji_1]. Quite the visual spectacle: like walking through a racist and revisionist _Amar Chitra Katha_. Saif Ali Khan's Uday Bhan is the only interesting character. Of noble [Rajput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajput) blood, he succumbs to eating crocodile meat, sexual assault (of chaste Hindu women who need protection), comical levels of bloodlust, a _fuckton_ of kohl, and villainous-looking sartorial choices.
