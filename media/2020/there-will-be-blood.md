Finally saw this with PLG. Daniel Day-Lewis' best performance IMO. Astounding, really.

> Mr. Day-Lewisâ€™s outsize performance, with its footnote references to Huston and strange, contorted Kabuki-like grimaces, occasionally breaks the skin of the filmâ€™s surface like a dangerous undertow. The actor seems to have invaded Plainviewâ€™s every atom, filling an otherwise empty vessel with so much rage and purpose you wait for him to blow. Itâ€™s a thrilling performance, among the greatest Iâ€™ve seen, purposefully alienating and brilliantly located at the juncture between cinematic realism and theatrical spectacle.

-- Manohla Dargis "[_An American Primitive, Forged in a Crucible of Blood and Oil_](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/movies/26bloo.html)"

Paul Dano is great as an ageless vampire-pastor ðŸ˜‘ [The _excellent_ soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood_(soundtrack)) was written by Jonny Greenwood (!) and features works by Arvo PÃ¤rt and Brahms.
