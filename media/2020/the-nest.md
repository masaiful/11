Watched with LD. Reminded me of "[_Hereditary_](/media/hereditary/)" (it's a slow burn) but with The Evil being this chimera of financial insolvency, really bad trust issues, childhood trauma, and severe affluenza. Jude Law was perfect, but Carrie Coon was _so fucking good_ as the beleagured yet passively complicit partner and mostly grieving person. The scene shot from the stable facing the manor was genius. [Sean Durkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Durkin) (writer and director) stuck the landing perfectly. Lovely stuff.
