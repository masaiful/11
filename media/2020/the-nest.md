Like "_Hereditary_" but with The Evil being a chimera of financial insolvency, really bad trust issues, broken childhoods, and affluenza (kinda... it's set in the 80s.) Jude Law was perfect but Carrie Coon was _so fucking good_ as the beleagured yet passively complicit partner and mostly grieving person. The scene shot from the stable looking at the manor was genius. Was worried about how Sean Durkin (writer and director) would end it but it was perfect. Lovely stuff.
