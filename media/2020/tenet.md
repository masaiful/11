Watched with CK. The plot doesn't make _any_ sense whatsoever. But very, very entertaining. Anyone who claims to understand what's going on after the first 32 viewings is a damned liar.

Excellent soundtrack by [Ludwig GÃ¶ransson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_G%C3%B6ransson) (first came by his work when watching _The Mandalorian_ and just knew he was [something special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62x19Bepc5s).) 

Also, [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square). And this:
