Watched with CK. The plot doesn't make _any_ sense whatsoever. But very, very entertaining. Anyone who claims to understand what's going on after the first 32 viewings is a damned liar. A perfect one-line review:

> So suit up [...] for what may not be Nolan at his best, but is definitely Nolan at his _most_.

Excellent soundtrack by [Ludwig GÃ¶ransson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_G%C3%B6ransson) (first came by his work when watching _The Mandalorian_ and just knew he was [something special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62x19Bepc5s).)

Also the [Sator Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square) for a standard dose of Nolan apophenia[^apophenia]. See also: [The pitch meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t23ZEKqGHzs).

[^apophenia]: It has no goddamn 'meaning' other than being a middle-school palindromic curiosity (and contributes nothing other than names to the plot.)
