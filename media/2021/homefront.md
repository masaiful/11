Boring Shit. Stallone wrote this. Background-watched because it looked revenge-y and Netflix listed it as a Top 10 movie in the US. Jason Statham is B+ as Jason Statham. This time, he growl-mumbles through this shit movie as an undercover DEA agent (with Special Forces training of course) who [speaks with an English accent](https://budomate.com/jason-statham/), presumably because he became a naturalized citizen beforehand.

> Well, he was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, which is between Stoke-on-Trent and Sheffield so that would be a mix of accents but closer to Yorkshire, but he grew up in Norfolk... which would give him an East Anglian accent. He then moved to London I believe... which gave him his slightly unusual not quite Cockney accent or Mockney as we call it.

Kate Bosworth was _excellent_ and looked like she subsisted purely on the aura of vegetables a few months before playing her role.
